# World Validation Status

This document describes the current validation status of the DikuMUD world data after implementing the validation system.

## Validation System

The world validation system has been integrated into the build process. It automatically checks for:

- **Duplicate VNUMs** across zones (rooms, mobiles, objects)
- **Missing cross-references** (exits to non-existent rooms, resets referencing non-existent entities)
- **Invalid/placeholder names** (e.g., "item3900", "mob123")
- **Format errors** (invalid dice notation, missing required fields)

## Current Status

✅ **All critical errors fixed!**

The validation now passes with only warnings. The server builds and runs successfully.

### Fixed Issues

1. **Duplicate VNUM conflicts** - RESOLVED
   - Moved gathol zone from 4200-4299 range to 3780-3789 range
   - Moved atmosphere_factory objects from 4200-4225 to 4050-4075 range
   - Fixed external references in gathol_ptarth_wilderness and zodanga_wilderness

2. **Invalid cross-references** - RESOLVED
   - Fixed gathol room references (3799 → 3789)
   - All zone interconnections now work correctly

### Remaining Warnings (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. Placeholder Object Names (86 objects)

These objects have generic namelists like "item3020", "item3900", etc. They are functional but should be given descriptive names in future work.

**Affected zones:**
- `lesser_helium`: 41 objects (3020-3099)
- `greater_helium`: 42 objects (3900-3992)
- `dead_sea_wilderness`: 3 objects (3754, 3755, 3766)

**Recommendation:** Replace placeholder names with descriptive ones as zones are updated. For example:
- `item3020` → `silver key`, `ancient scroll`, etc.
- `item3900` → `ceremonial dagger`, `healing potion`, etc.

#### 2. Future Expansion Rooms (27 rooms)

Some exits in `atmosphere_factory` point to rooms that don't exist yet (4125-4146). These are intentional placeholders for future zone expansion.

**Affected rooms:** 4054, 4055, 4056, 4057, 4059, 4064-4074, 4120, 4147

**Current behavior:** Server logs warnings but continues running normally. Players see these as exits they cannot use yet.

**Options for future:**
1. Create the missing rooms to complete the zone
2. Remove the exits if expansion is not planned
3. Leave as-is for future development

## Running Validation

To check validation status:

```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
make validate-world
```

The validation will:
- ✅ Pass (exit 0) if only warnings are present
- ❌ Fail (exit 1) if critical errors are found

## Adding New Zones

When adding new zones, the validation system will automatically check:

1. **Unique VNUMs**: Ensure your zone uses VNUMs that don't conflict with existing zones
2. **Valid references**: All room exits, mob/object resets must reference existing entities
3. **Proper names**: Avoid placeholder names like "item####" or "mob####"

See [WORLD_BUILDING.md](WORLD_BUILDING.md) for detailed instructions.

## Validation as Errors vs Warnings

The current configuration treats placeholder names as **warnings** rather than errors. This allows builds to succeed while still alerting developers to items that need attention.

To make placeholder names block builds (errors instead of warnings), edit `tools/validate_world.py` and change `self.warning()` calls to `self.error()` calls in the placeholder detection sections.

## Summary

✅ **Validation system is working correctly**
✅ **All critical errors are fixed**
✅ **Server runs successfully**
⚠️ **115 warnings remain** (86 placeholder names + 29 future expansion rooms)

These warnings are documented and non-blocking. They should be addressed as part of ongoing world development but do not prevent the game from running.
