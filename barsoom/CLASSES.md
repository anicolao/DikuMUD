# Barsoom Character Classes

This document defines the four primary character classes available to player characters in the Barsoom MUD, replacing the traditional fantasy classes (warrior, cleric, magic user, thief) with classes appropriate to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars.

## Design Philosophy

On Barsoom, there are no clerics (the "gods" are frauds) and no magic users (though there are scientists whose advanced technology might seem like magic). The classes reflect the harsh, dying world of Mars where survival depends on martial prowess, scientific knowledge, social cunning, or deadly precision.

## The Four Classes

### 1. WARRIOR (Dwar/Padwar)

**Inspired By:** John Carter, Tars Tarkas, Tan Hadron, Carthoris (as fighter), Kantos Kan, Gor Hajus (combat aspect)

**Description:** The backbone of Martian civilization. Warriors are masters of the long sword, radium pistol, and close combat. They excel in direct confrontation and can withstand tremendous physical punishment. Whether a green Martian with four arms or a red Martian noble, warriors dominate the battlefield through raw skill and courage.

**Found In:** 
- Helium (disciplined military tradition)
- All major red Martian city-states
- Green Martian hordes (Thark, Warhoon, Torquas)
- First Born cities (Sea of Omean)

**Primary Stats:** Strength, Constitution
**Secondary Stats:** Dexterity
**Weak Stats:** Intelligence, Charisma

**Abilities:**
- Highest hit points per level
- Best weapon proficiency and damage
- Superior armor usage
- Combat maneuvers (disarm, charge, multi-attack for green Martians)
- Battle leadership at higher levels
- Can fight effectively with various weapons

**Starting Equipment:** Long sword, radium pistol, leather harness with metal ornaments, fighting leathers

**Advancement:** Warriors progress from Padwar (Lieutenant) through Dwar (Captain), Odwar (General), to legendary Warlord status. Advancement requires demonstrated combat prowess and battlefield victories.

**Stat Requirements:** Strength 12+, Constitution 10+

**Best For:** Players who roll high Strength (16+) or Constitution (15+)

### 2. SCIENTIST (Savant/Inventor)

**Inspired By:** Ras Thavas, Phor Tak, Carthoris (as inventor), Dejah Thoris (astronomy), Ulysses Paxton (medical knowledge)

**Description:** Barsoom's scientists are the keepers of ancient knowledge and creators of wondrous devices. They can perform brain transplants, create invisibility devices, manufacture atmosphere, and build sophisticated navigation systems. While not primarily combatants, their inventions and knowledge make them invaluable. They combine the roles of engineer, surgeon, and natural philosopher.

**Found In:**
- Toonol (Ras Thavas' laboratories)
- Helium (royal laboratories, atmosphere plant)
- Jhama (home of Phor Tak)
- Morbus (hormad creation facilities)

- Use scientific weapons (radium rifles, disintegrator rays)
- Limited combat capability but can use ranged weapons

**Starting Equipment:** Surgical kit, diagnostic instruments, notebook, small radium pistol, scholar's robes

**Advancement:** Scientists progress from Apprentice through Journeyman, Master Savant, to the legendary title of "Master Mind." Advancement requires successful experiments and contributions to knowledge.

**Stat Requirements:** Intelligence 14+, Wisdom 10+

**Best For:** Players who roll high Intelligence (16+) or want to focus on problem-solving and technology

---

### 3. NOBLE (Jed/Princess)

**Inspired By:** Dejah Thoris, Tara of Helium, Tardos Mors, Gahan of Gathol, Thuvia of Ptarth

**Description:** Nobility on Barsoom is not mere privilege—it's a responsibility requiring courage, wisdom, and leadership. Nobles command respect through force of personality and lead through example. They excel at diplomacy, can inspire followers, and possess the social standing to access powerful allies. Many nobles are also skilled fighters, blending martial prowess with social acumen.

**Found In:**
- Helium (greatest concentration of nobility)
- All red Martian city-states (Ptarth, Gathol, Zodanga, etc.)
- First Born nobility (Sea of Omean)
- Yellow Martian cities (Kadabra, Illall)
- Even green Martian Jeddaks (though rulership through strength)

**Primary Stats:** Charisma, Wisdom
**Secondary Stats:** Intelligence or Strength (noble warriors vs. scholar nobles)
**Weak Stats:** Constitution

**Abilities:**
- Inspire and command followers
- Diplomatic persuasion (talk way out of danger, negotiate alliances)
- Access to resources and allies
- Rally troops in combat (+morale, +accuracy)
- Detect deception and read motives
- Command respect (intimidate or befriend based on reputation)
- Moderate combat ability (better than scientists, less than warriors)
- Can requisition equipment and supplies from friendly cities

**Starting Equipment:** Ornate long sword, jeweled harness, signet ring of noble house, well-crafted radium pistol

**Advancement:** Nobles progress through ranks from Odwar (title holder) through Jed (minor ruler) to Jeddak (supreme ruler). Advancement requires successful leadership and maintaining honor.

**Stat Requirements:** Charisma 13+, Wisdom 10+

**Best For:** Players who roll high Charisma (16+) or want to focus on social interaction and leadership

---

### 4. ASSASSIN (Shadow/Blade)

**Inspired By:** Gor Hajus (assassin of Toonol), Gahan of Gathol (disguise and stealth), Nur An (skilled warrior using tactics)

**Description:** In the cutthroat politics of Barsoom's city-states, assassins are specialists in stealth, deception, and surgical violence. The Assassins' Guild of Toonol is legendary, but practitioners exist in every city. They strike from shadows, use poison and precision rather than brute force, and can infiltrate where warriors cannot tread. They blend combat skill with cunning and stealth.

**Found In:**
- Toonol (famous Assassins' Guild)
- Zodanga (notorious for political intrigue)
- Dusar (Astok's schemes)
- Phundahl (Xaxa's intrigues)

**Best For:** Players who roll high Dexterity (16+) or want to focus on stealth and precision

## Class Comparison Table

| Class      | Hit Points | Combat | Skills    | Primary Role        | Stat Focus        |
|------------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Warrior    | Highest   | Best   | Low       | Front-line fighter  | STR/CON          |
| Scientist  | Low       | Poor   | Highest   | Support/Utility     | INT/WIS          |
| Noble      | Medium    | Medium | High      | Leadership/Social   | CHA/WIS          |
| Assassin   | Low-Med   | Good   | High      | Stealth/Precision   | DEX/INT          |

## Multi-Classing Considerations

Some iconic Barsoom characters blend classes:
- **John Carter**: Primarily Warrior, but with Noble aspects (Warlord title, command)
- **Carthoris**: Warrior with Scientist abilities (inventor)
- **Gahan**: Noble with Assassin skills (disguise and stealth)
- **Ulysses Paxton**: Warrior with Scientist training (Earth soldier + surgeon)
- **Gor Hajus**: Assassin with Warrior capabilities

If multi-classing is implemented, these combinations work well thematically:
- Warrior/Noble (noble warriors like Carthoris, Tan Hadron)
- Noble/Scientist (intellectual royalty like Dejah Thoris)
- Assassin/Warrior (professional killers like Gor Hajus)
- Any combination at reduced effectiveness in each class

## Race-Class Affinities

### Red Martians
**Can be any class.** Red Martians dominate all civilized professions and make up the majority of all classes.

### Green Martians
**Best as Warriors.** Green Martians have four arms and tremendous strength, making them devastating warriors. A rare green Martian Noble (like Tars Tarkas) leads through combat prowess rather than social graces. Green Martian Scientists and Assassins are extremely rare but not impossible.

**Bonuses:** +2 STR, +1 CON, four-armed combat (extra attacks)
**Penalties:** -2 CHA (feared by most), -1 INT (primitive culture)

### White Martians (Therns)
**Best as Nobles or Scientists.** The Therns ran their religious fraud through false piety and cunning, making them natural leaders and schemers. After the fall of their religion, surviving Therns might become any class.

**Bonuses:** +1 CHA (practice in deception), +1 WIS (religious training)
**Penalties:** -1 STR (less martial culture)

### Black Martians (First Born)
**Best as Warriors or Nobles.** The First Born are a martial culture of slavers who value combat prowess and domination.

**Bonuses:** +1 STR, +1 CON
**Penalties:** -1 WIS (arrogant, blind to truth)

### Yellow Martians
**Best as Scientists or Warriors.** The isolated Yellow Martian cities of the north maintain ancient technology and martial traditions.

**Bonuses:** +1 INT (technical knowledge), +1 STR (hardy northern stock)
**Penalties:** -1 CHA (isolated, less diplomatic experience)

### Kaldanes
**Must be Scientists.** Kaldanes are pure intellect—bodiless heads that control headless rykor bodies. They cannot be warriors (rykors are clumsy), nobles (too alien), or assassins (lack dexterity).

**Bonuses:** +3 INT (pure brain), +2 WIS (logical thinking)
**Penalties:** -3 STR (rykor bodies weak), -3 DEX (poor coordination), -2 CHA (horrifying appearance), -2 CON (fragile head)

### Lotharians
**Best as Scientists or Nobles.** The dying race of Lothar created phantom warriors through mental discipline, making them skilled in mental arts.

**Special Ability:** Can create phantom creatures at higher levels (3/day at level 10+)
**Bonuses:** +1 INT, +1 WIS (mental training)
**Penalties:** -1 CON (decadent, dying race)

### Earthmen
**Can be any class, bonus to Warrior.** Like John Carter and Ulysses Paxton, Earthmen have incredible strength in Mars' lower gravity.

**Bonuses:** +2 STR (Earth gravity advantage), +1 CON (Earth physiology)
**Penalties:** -1 WIS initially (unfamiliar with Barsoom, negated after level 3)

## Class Equipment and Wealth

**Warriors** start with standard military equipment and modest wealth. Advance through battlefield salvage and military pay.

**Scientists** start with specialized tools and low wealth. Advance through patronage, selling inventions, and quest rewards.

**Nobles** start with superior equipment and good wealth (10x standard). Advance through inheritance, tribute, and political position.

**Assassins** start with specialized tools and modest wealth. Advance through contracts, theft, and "found" wealth.

## Thematic Notes

These classes reflect Barsoom's unique setting:

1. **No Magic:** There are no clerics or wizards. The "magic" of Barsoom is advanced science (radium weapons, surgery, atmosphere plants, etc.)

2. **Martial Culture:** Even scientists and nobles are expected to be able to defend themselves. Everyone learns the sword.

3. **Dying World:** Mars is ancient and dying. Characters must be resourceful and tough to survive.

4. **Honor Code:** Most civilized Martians (especially red Martians) follow a strict code of honor. Assassins operate outside this code but are still bound by professional ethics.

5. **Social Hierarchy:** Class matters on Barsoom. Nobles expect deference; warriors earn respect through prowess; scientists through knowledge; assassins through fear.

This class system preserves the spirit of the original DikuMUD classes while adapting them to the unique world of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars. Warriors remain the combat specialists, Scientists replace magic users with their knowledge and inventions, Nobles combine aspects of clerics (leadership) with social cunning, and Assassins bring the thief's skills but with a deadlier edge appropriate to Barsoom's harsh politics.
