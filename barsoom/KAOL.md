# Kaol - Allied City-State

## Overview

Kaol is a proud and honorable red Martian city-state, ruled by the noble Jeddak Kulan Tith. The city is featured prominently in "Thuvia, Maid of Mars" (Book 4) as the home of one of Mars' most honorable rulers. Kulan Tith was betrothed to Princess Thuvia of Ptarth, but when he realized she loved another (Carthoris of Helium), he nobly released her from the betrothal - an act that exemplifies the highest ideals of Martian honor. Kaol is known throughout Barsoom for its emphasis on honor, military excellence, and diplomatic wisdom. The city is a staunch ally of Helium, Ptarth, and Gathol, forming part of the northern alliance network.

## Geography

Kaol is located in the northern equatorial region of Barsoom, several days' journey north of Ptarth. The city is strategically positioned on elevated ground commanding views of the surrounding dead sea bottoms. The architecture reflects traditional red Martian design with an emphasis on martial strength tempered by elegance. The city serves as an important link in the northern alliance chain, maintaining regular communication and trade with Ptarth to the south and serving as a bulwark against hostile forces.
