# Thark Territory - Green Martian Zone

## Overview

Thark Territory is the homeland of the Thark horde, one of the most powerful green Martian tribes on Barsoom. This zone represents the ancient ruined city that serves as the primary base for the Tharks, a nomadic warrior people who stand 15 feet tall with four arms and fierce tusks. Under the leadership of Jeddak Tars Tarkas, the Tharks have become allies of John Carter and the city of Helium, making this zone a friendly but exotic location for adventurers.

## Zone Design Notes

**Room Count:** 50 rooms (comparable to Lesser Helium's 51 rooms)

This zone is designed as a medium-priority location that provides:
- Cultural diversity (green Martian vs red Martian)
- Allied territory with unique goods and services
- Mid-level challenges (8-16)
- Mount acquisition (thoats)
- Quest opportunities
- Lore integration with John Carter storyline

The zone is larger than the connecting Dead Sea Wilderness (30 rooms) but similar in size to Lesser Helium (51 rooms), reflecting its importance as a major green Martian settlement and ally of Helium.

**Numbering:**
- Zone number: 40 (using 4000s range as specified)
- Rooms: 4000-4049
- Mobiles: 4050-4089
- Objects: 4090-4099

This leaves room 4050-4099 range available for future expansion or overlap with objects if needed.
