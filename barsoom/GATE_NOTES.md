- **Airship Travel:** Days between major cities
- **Channel to Surface:** Minutes to climb banks

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Placeholder Rooms:** Rooms 3100 and 3503 are referenced but don't exist yet - they are intentional placeholders for future zones

2. **Sector Types:** 
   - Dead sea bottom should use sector type 2 (Field) or create new type
   - City uses sector 1 (City)

3. **Zone Transitions:**
   - Consider "travel" zones for long journeys
   - Or abstract with descriptions
   - Random encounters in wilderness

4. **Airship Travel:**
   - Could implement as fast travel system
   - Or actual flying navigation
   - Landing platforms at cities

5. **Consistency:**
   - All connections should reference Barsoom geography
   - Maintain lore-accurate distances
   - Thin atmosphere affects travel
   - Lower gravity affects jumping/falling
