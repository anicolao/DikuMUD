## Technology Categories

The synthetic technologies fall into these categories:
1. **Ray Weapons** - Direct adaptation of radium weapon technology
2. **Medical Devices** - Based on Ras Thavas's work and general Martian medical science
3. **Neural/Mental Tech** - Inspired by Kaldane mental discipline and Thuvia's abilities
4. **Environmental Systems** - Extensions of atmosphere factory and life support
5. **Sensory Enhancement** - Detection and analysis devices
6. **Defensive Systems** - Force fields and protective devices
7. **Utility Devices** - General purpose technological tools

## Design Philosophy

All technologies maintain these principles:
1. **Radium-powered** - Most devices use radium as primary power source
2. **Harness-mounted** - Portable devices attach to standard Martian harness
3. **Scientific basis** - No "magic" - all effects explained through technology
4. **Rarity appropriate** - Common effects are common tech, rare effects are rare/experimental
5. **Cultural fit** - Technologies match the aesthetic of Barsoom civilization
6. **Game balance** - Mechanical effects remain identical to original spells

## Terminology Changes

- "Cast" → "Activate"
- "Spell" → "Technology" or "Device"
- "Mana" → "Power charge" or "Energy"
- "Magic user" → "Scientist"
- "Cleric" → "Noble" (as per help file already)
- "Enchanted" → "Enhanced" or "Powered"
- "Magical" → "Technological"

## Implementation Notes

The game mechanics remain completely unchanged. Only flavor text and terminology are updated:
- Command name changes from "cast" to "activate"
- Item descriptions change to technological themes
- Effect messages reference technology instead of magic
- Help files updated to describe devices instead of spells
- Same level requirements, same costs, same effects

This maintains backward compatibility with save files, world files, and game balance while providing complete thematic consistency with the Barsoom setting.
