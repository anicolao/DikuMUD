# Zodanga - Enemy City-State

## Overview

Zodanga is the great rival city of Helium and one of the most powerful red Martian city-states. Known for its militaristic culture, political intrigue, and aggressive expansionism, Zodanga represents a darker side of Barsoomian civilization. The city is ruled by Than Kosis, Jeddak of Zodanga, whose ambitions threaten the peace of Mars. This is where Prince Sab Than plots to marry Dejah Thoris and dominate Helium.

## Geography

Zodanga is located approximately 1000+ miles north-northeast of Lesser Helium across the dead sea bottom. The city is built on elevated ground with massive fortifications and imposing architecture. Unlike Helium's graceful scarlet and gold towers, Zodanga features harsh angles, dark metal, and militaristic designs meant to intimidate.

## Integration with Barsoom Lore

Zodanga plays a crucial role in Edgar Rice Burroughs' "A Princess of Mars":

- Than Kosis schemes to marry his son Sab Than to Dejah Thoris
- This would give Zodanga control over Helium through alliance
- John Carter opposes this plot and fights for Helium
- Zodanga represents the darker, more aggressive side of red Martian civilization
- The city's ambitions drive much of the conflict in the books

The zone captures this atmosphere of military might, political scheming, and moral ambiguity that makes Zodanga the perfect antagonist city to Helium's heroic idealism.
