# Dead Sea Wilderness - Connecting Zone

## Overview

The Dead Sea Wilderness is the dangerous expanse of ancient sea bottom that lies between the Twin Cities of Helium. This zone represents the 75-mile journey between Lesser Helium (west) and Greater Helium (east), providing both an elevated roadway for safer travel and the treacherous sea bottom for those who descend.

## Geography

The zone covers the vast dead sea bottom, an ancient ocean floor now dry and desolate. The terrain includes:

- **Elevated Roadway** - Ancient stone causeway connecting the Twin Cities
- **Dead Sea Bottom** - Ochre moss-covered plains far below
- **Rock Formations** - Strange weathered stones jutting from the floor
- **Ancient Ruins** - Remnants of civilizations long fallen
- **Wilderness Areas** - Open expanses where predators hunt

The thin Martian atmosphere and harsh conditions make this a challenging environment for travelers.
