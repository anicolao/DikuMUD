## Thematic Notes

1. **Dying World:** All races face the slow death of Mars—they must cooperate or perish.

2. **Advanced Age:** Most Martian races live for centuries, bringing wisdom and experience.

4. **Egg-Laying:** All Martian races are oviparous, with five-year incubation periods (except Earthmen).

5. **Minimal Clothing:** Martian races wear elaborate harnesses and jewelry but minimal cloth, adapted to temperature-controlled cities.

6. **Technological Heritage:** All civilized races use advanced technology that might seem magical—radium weapons, airships, surgery, etc.

All races advance at the same rate—racial bonuses don't affect experience requirements.

### Equipment Restrictions

- All others use standard Medium equipment

### Starting Languages
- All player characters know Barsoomian (common tongue)
- Green Martians also know Green Martian tribal language
- Kaldanes also know Kaldane language
- Additional languages can be learned

### Lifespan
- Martian races: Centuries (400-1000 years)
- Earthmen: Unknown on Barsoom (John Carter hasn't aged in decades)
- Game effect: All races effectively immortal for play purposes

---

This racial system provides diverse options while maintaining balance and staying true to Edgar Rice Burroughs' vision of Barsoom. Each race offers unique roleplaying opportunities and mechanical advantages that complement the four-class system.
