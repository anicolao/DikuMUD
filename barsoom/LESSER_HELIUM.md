- West: Thark green Martian territory (Zone 40) - Connected via Dead Sea Wilderness (Zone 33)
- North: Trade routes to other city-states (future expansion)
- South: Atmosphere factories and dead sea bottom plains
- Vertical: Airship docks above, sewers below

This zone provides the foundation for the entire Barsoom MUD experience.

## Geography and Travel

### Geographic Position
Lesser Helium sits in a strategic location:
- Elevated above the dead sea bottom
- 75 miles from Greater Helium to the east
- Ancient dried channel runs beneath and through the city
- Surrounded by vast dead sea bottom plains covered in ochre moss
- Thark territory lies days of travel to the west/northwest
- Zodanga 1000+ miles to the north-northeast (distant enemy)
- Atmosphere factories several hundred miles to the south

### Travel Times (from Barsoom lore)
- **Helium to Greater Helium:** Days by foot across dead sea bottom, hours by airship
- **Dead Sea Bottom Crossings:** Days to weeks on thoat (eight-legged Martian mount)
- **Airship Travel:** Days between major cities across the planet
- **Channel to Surface:** Minutes to climb the steep banks
- **Lesser Helium to Thark Territory:** Multiple days by thoat, faster by airship
- **Lesser Helium to Atmosphere Factory:** Long journey of several hundred miles

### Sector Types
The world of Barsoom uses different terrain sectors:
- **City (Sector 1):** Lesser Helium interior, Greater Helium, Thark ruins
- **Field (Sector 2):** Dead sea bottom plains, ochre moss wilderness
- **Inside (Sector 0):** Building interiors, atmosphere factory complex

### Environmental Notes
- **Thin Atmosphere:** Affects travel speed and endurance
- **Lower Gravity:** Affects jumping distance and falling damage
- **Ochre Moss:** Covers much of the dead sea bottom, provides some vegetation
- **Ancient Ruins:** Scattered throughout the wilderness, remnants of lost civilizations
