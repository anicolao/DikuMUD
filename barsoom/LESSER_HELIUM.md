# Lesser Helium - Starting Zone

## Overview

Lesser Helium is one of the Twin Cities of Helium, the most powerful red Martian city-state. It sits on the western bank of an ancient dried sea channel, connected to Greater Helium (75 miles to the east) by massive bridges spanning the chasm. This is where new arrivals to Barsoom begin their adventures.

## Geography

Lesser Helium is built on elevated ground overlooking the dead sea bottom. The city features:

- **Temple District** - Central religious and civic area with the Temple of Issus (reskinned for red Martian worship)
- **Market Plaza** - Commercial heart of the city
- **Guild Quarter** - Training facilities for warriors, scientists, and adventurers
- **Residential Areas** - Including both wealthy and poor districts
- **City Walls** - Defensive fortifications with gate towers
- **River Channel** - Ancient dried waterway (now the dead sea bottom passage)
