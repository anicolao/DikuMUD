# Ptarth - Allied City-State

## Overview

Ptarth is a proud and well-established red Martian city-state, ruled by the noble Jeddak Thuvan Dihn. The city is the home of Princess Thuvia, one of the most remarkable women of Barsoom, known for her unique ability to mentally control banths. Ptarth is featured prominently in "Thuvia, Maid of Mars" (Book 4) as the starting point of the story when Thuvia is kidnapped, triggering a diplomatic crisis that nearly plunges Mars into war. The city represents traditional red Martian values, military strength balanced with diplomatic wisdom, and fierce loyalty to its allies, particularly Helium.

## Geography

Ptarth is located in the northern equatorial region of Barsoom, several days' journey by airship north of Gathol and northeast of Helium. The city is built on elevated ground with commanding views of the surrounding dead sea bottoms. The architecture reflects traditional red Martian design with magnificent towers, military fortifications, and the famous palace gardens where Thuvia spent her youth. The city serves as a strategic location for northern trade routes and military coordination.

## Integration with Barsoom Lore

**Kulan Tith:** The honorable resolution of Thuvia's betrothal to Kulan Tith of Kaol demonstrates the nobility possible in Martian society. This connects Ptarth to Kaol diplomatically.

**Alliance Network:** Ptarth is part of the coalition of cities allied with Helium, including Gathol, Kaol, and others. This network is vital to Mars's political landscape.
