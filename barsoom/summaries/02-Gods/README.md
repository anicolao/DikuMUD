# The Gods of Mars - Summary

## Plot Summary

Ten years after being torn from Mars, John Carter returns to find himself in the Valley Dor, the Martian heaven which proves to be a nightmarish trap. He discovers that the Therns, the supposedly holy white-skinned priests, are actually cruel frauds who enslave pilgrims who come to die in paradise. With his son Carthoris and Tars Tarkas, Carter battles plant men and Therns before being captured by the First Bornâ€”black-skinned pirates who serve Issus, the false goddess. Carter exposes the religious fraud, unites former enemies, and launches a revolution that shatters millennia of deception, but the story ends on a devastating cliffhanger when Dejah Thoris is trapped in the Temple of the Sun with the villainous Phaidor and Thuvia.
