- Numbers: limited by creator's power

**Special Cases:**
- Kar Komak: phantom gained independence
- Tario's creations: most powerful and realistic
- Weakened Lotharians: fewer, less real phantoms

**Game Implementation:**
- Summon mechanic
- Mana/concentration resource
- Duration-based
- Quality scales with skill
- Dispellable
- Unique to Lotharian characters/areas

**Visual Effects:**
