## Conclusion

This comprehensive technology guide consolidates all innovations, techniques, and devices from the John Carter series. Technologies range from universal (radium power, airships) to unique (Atmosphere Factory, specific inventions), from ancient and mysterious (Temple of Sun) to revolutionary new developments (invisibility, brain transplants). Each technology includes zone assignments and usage frequencies to guide game implementation and world-building, ensuring a coherent and balanced representation of Barsoom's diverse technological landscape.

The technologies reflect the dying world theme - ancient capabilities lost, current maintenance of existing systems, and occasional revolutionary breakthroughs. They also show cultural diversity - from Yellow Martian magnetic ships to Lotharian mental powers, from Kaldane biological engineering to Ras Thavas's medical miracles. Together, they create a rich, varied technological landscape that supports both sword-and-planet adventure and science fiction wonder.
