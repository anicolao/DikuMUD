- Instant invisibility
- Can be toggled on/off
- Requires power (radium fuel)
- Battery life limited

**Capabilities:**
- **Complete Visual Invisibility:** Cannot be seen
- **Includes Possessions:** Clothes, weapons invisible too
- **Maintained Movement:** Can move while invisible
- **No Sound Masking:** Still makes noise
- **No Odor Masking:** Can still be smelled
- **Shadows:** May cast faint shadow in bright light

**Limitations:**
- Power supply finite (battery runs down)
- Doesn't hide sound or scent
- Physical contact reveals presence
- Footprints in dust/sand
- Displacement of air/water
- Shadows in strong light
- Device can malfunction
- Wearer still solid (can be touched/hit)

**Combat Applications:**
- Stealth infiltration
- Assassination
- Espionage
- Surprise attacks
- Escape scenarios
- Scout missions
- Tactical advantage

**Strategic Importance:**
- Military game-changer
- Tul Axtar hoards them
- Used with flying assassins
- Assassination tool
- Terror weapon
- Paranoia fuel

**Game Implementation:**

**As Player Ability:**
- Temporary stealth (power limited)
- Perfect visual concealment
- Still detectable by sound
- Can trigger traps
- Some enemies sense other ways
- Strategic resource management

**As Enemy Advantage:**
- Invisible assassins

- Hard to target
- Area-of-effect counters work
- Sound detection helps
- Pets/animals can sense

**Counters:**
- Listen for sounds
- Watch for footprints

**Visual Description:**
Small device, box-like or belt-mounted. Radium glow when active (faint). Control switches visible. Compact and elegant. Martian engineering aesthetic. When activated, wearer fades to complete transparency. Eerie shimmer as it activates/deactivates. Empty harness and floating weapons if wearer moves.

**Ethical Concerns:**
- Assassination technology
- Eliminates fair combat
- Creates paranoia
- Abused by tyrants
- Phor Tak's mad gift to Tul Axtar
