## Plot Summary

Tan Hadron of Hastor, a lowly padwar, loves Sanoma Tora, daughter of a powerful jed, but she disdains him for his low rank.

Through battles with cannibals, invisibility cloaks, flying assassins, and the mad Jeddak Tul Axtar of Jahar, Tan Hadron proves his worth. He rescues both women, but discovers that Sanoma Tora is shallow and selfish, while Tavia is brave and true. He chooses genuine love over false infatuation, finding happiness with Tavia, who is revealed to be a princess herself.
