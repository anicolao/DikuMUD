**RARE:** Limited spawns even in their home zone (5-50 individuals per zone)
- Examples: Flying Assassins (even in Ghasta), Sorak, actual Lotharians (vs. their phantoms)

**COMMON:** Regular encounters and numerous spawns in their zone (50+ individuals per zone)
- Examples: 
  - Red Martians in their cities
  - Therns in Valley Dor/Thern Temples
