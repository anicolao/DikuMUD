# The Warlord of Mars - Summary

## Plot Summary

John Carter waits desperately for the Temple of the Sun to rotate and reveal whether Dejah Thoris survived. When it finally opens, he discovers she has escaped with Thuvia, pursued by the villainous Matai Shang and his son Thurid. Carter chases them across Marsâ€”through the north polar regions where he encounters the yellow men of Okar, through ice and snow, facing white apes and new dangers. He discovers Kadabra, the golden city, and navigates political intrigue while racing to save Dejah Thoris. In a climactic finale, Carter defeats his enemies, rescues his princess, and is proclaimed Warlord of all Mars, uniting red, green, white, black, and yellow races under peace.
