# Technology in The Warlord of Mars

## Yellow Martian Technology

### Magnetic Ships
**Description:** Unique vessels that use magnetic propulsion instead of eighth ray technology.

**Technical Details:**
- Powered by magnetic attraction/repulsion
- Navigate using natural magnetic features
- Can operate on water and over land (where magnetic rocks exist)
- Silent operation
- Require special navigation skills
- Different power source than southern ships
- Adapted to polar conditions

**Operation:**
- Pilot must understand magnetic geography
- Use attraction to magnetic rocks for propulsion
- Repulsion for braking and steering
- Cannot operate everywhere (need magnetic materials)
- Sophisticated control systems

**Advantages:**
- Effective in polar region
- Independent power source
- Adapted to local conditions
- Unique tactical capabilities

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to areas with magnetic rocks
- Cannot travel everywhere
- Requires specialized knowledge
- Different from southern technology

**Visual Description:**
Sleek vessels with yellow/gold metallic hulls. Smooth lines suggesting magnetic flow. Control mechanisms using magnetic principles. Ornate decorations in yellow Martian style. Built for cold weather with enclosed sections. Navigation instruments showing magnetic readings. Beautiful and functional design.

**Game Implementation:**
- Unique vehicle type
- Magnetic navigation mechanics
- Limited operational areas
- Acquisition unlocks new regions
- Requires skill to pilot
- Quest objectives (capture/use)
