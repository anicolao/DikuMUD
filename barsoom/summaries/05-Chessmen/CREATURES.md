The Kaldanes and Rykors represent one of Edgar Rice Burroughs' most unique and disturbing alien races, exploring themes of consciousness, slavery, and the relationship between mind and body. Their inclusion in a game provides unique mechanical opportunities and deep philosophical questions alongside standard Martian sword-and-planet adventure.
