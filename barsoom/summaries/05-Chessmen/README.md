# The Chessmen of Mars - Summary

## Plot Summary

Tara of Helium, daughter of John Carter and Dejah Thoris, is swept away by a storm to the land of the Kaldanesâ€”bodiless heads that ride headless bodies called Rykors. She meets Gahan of Gathol, who loves her but she disdainfully rejects. As Turan the panthan, Gahan follows and protects her through adventures in the ancient Jed jetan (Martian chess) game played with living pieces to the death. Through his valor, cleverness, and devotion, Gahan proves his worth, defeats enemies, rescues Tara, and wins her love as she learns not to judge by rank alone.
