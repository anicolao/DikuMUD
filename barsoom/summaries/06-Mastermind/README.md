# The Master Mind of Mars - Summary

## Plot Summary

Ulysses Paxton, an Earth soldier dying on a World War I battlefield, awakens in the laboratory of Ras Thavas, the Master Mind of Marsâ€”a brilliant but amoral surgeon who performs brain transplants. When the body of beautiful Valla Dia is used to house the brain of an old empress, Paxton helps Valla's consciousness escape in an aged body. Racing across Mars, battling enemies, and navigating body-swap complications, Paxton uses the knowledge he gained from Ras Thavas to restore Valla to her rightful body and wins her love, while the Master Mind learns that science without ethics is hollow.
