- Highly functional but decorated
- Silent or near-silent operation
- Advanced compared to 1860s Earth
- Somewhat mysterious in operation
- Reliable but irreplaceable if lost

Visual style should suggest:
- Advanced but not modern (no LCD screens, no obvious electronics)

- Ornate and decorated (never purely utilitarian)
- Metallic and jeweled (wealth and status displayed)
- Smooth curves and elegant lines
- Alien but not incomprehensible
- Ancient but still functional

These technologies create a unique aesthetic that blends advanced science with sword-and-planet adventure, suitable for game implementation with appropriate visual and mechanical representations.
