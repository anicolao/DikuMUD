# Zodanga Wilderness - Northern Connector Zone

## Overview

The Zodanga Wilderness represents the dangerous frontier between the territories controlled by enemy Zodanga to the northeast and the allied cities of Helium and Gathol to the southwest. This vast expanse of dead sea bottom, ancient ruins, and hostile territory serves as both a natural barrier and a contested borderland. Green Martian patrols, dangerous predators, and Zodangan scouts make this region treacherous for travelers attempting the overland journey between these distant city-states.

## Geography

The wilderness stretches across several hundred miles of dead sea bottom plains between Zodanga's western approaches and the territories leading to Gathol and Helium. The terrain is dominated by ochre moss-covered plains, scattered ancient ruins, and occasional elevated ridges that provide vantage points over the surrounding landscape. The area lies at the intersection of multiple territorial claims, with neither Zodanga nor the allied cities maintaining permanent settlements here.

- Provides overland route paralleling future airship travel
- Creates buffer zone between hostile and friendly territories
- Offers mid-level content between starter zones and high-level cities
