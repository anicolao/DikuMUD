# Atmosphere Factory - Major Zone Complex

## Overview

The Atmosphere Factory is the most critical installation on Barsoom, producing the oxygen that sustains all life on the dying planet. This ancient facility, built by a long-lost civilization, continues to operate through radium-powered perpetual motion engines. The zone complex consists of three interconnected zones: a southern approach/connector zone, the main factory (levels 4-8), and the deeper restricted levels where renegade scientists conduct forbidden experiments (levels 8-12).

## Geographical Context

**Location:** Several hundred miles south of Lesser Helium, across the dead sea bottom plains.

**Strategic Importance:**
- Single most critical location on Mars
- Without it, all life ends within months
- Requires minimal staff (normally 10-20 engineers)
- Remote location makes it vulnerable to attack
- Must be defended at all costs

**From "A Princess of Mars":** The atmosphere factory plays a crucial role in John Carter's first adventure, and its ancient machinery represents both the lost glory of old Mars and the desperate survival of the present.

**From "The Chessmen of Mars":** References to atmosphere factories emphasize their critical importance and the ancient technology that modern Martians can barely maintain.

## Development Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Create Zone 34 (Southern Approach) as connector
2. **Phase 2**: Build Zone 41 (Main Factory levels 4-8)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement Zone 42 (Lower Levels levels 8-12)
4. **Phase 4**: Add special procedures and quests
5. **Phase 5**: Polish and balance

This phased approach allows testing at each stage and ensures core functionality before advanced features.
