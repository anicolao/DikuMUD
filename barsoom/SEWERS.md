## Connection to Midgaard

This zone corresponds to the "Sewers" in the original Midgaard design, adapted for the Barsoom setting. The ancient Martian civilization's infrastructure provides the same role as Midgaard's sewers - a dangerous but rewarding area for beginning adventurers to gain experience and equipment.

## Lore

The sewers beneath Lesser Helium date back to a civilization that predated the current red Martian cities. The sophisticated engineering and mysterious technology suggest they were built by the same ancient race that created the Atmosphere Factories. The deepest sections were sealed deliberately, possibly to contain dangerous experiments or protect valuable artifacts. Over the millennia, the upper levels have become home to various creatures, while the deep vault remains mostly undisturbed, guarded by ancient mechanisms that still function after countless ages.
