# PR Summary: Fix Flaky Experience Gain Test

## Problem
The `test_experience_gain` integration test was flaky because the character didn't always kill the creature quickly enough to see the experience gain message within the test timeout.

## Solution
Implemented a test framework extension system that allows dynamic injection of test-specific objects. Created "Thor's Hammer" - an impossibly powerful weapon (1d4+200 damage) that guarantees one-hit kills.

## Key Changes

### 1. Test Framework Enhancement (`tools/integration_test_runner.py`)
- Added `test_extensions` support to ServerManager
- Extensions are YAML files that get merged into zone files during test setup only
- Automatically rebuilds world files with test objects included
- All changes isolated to test_lib directory (never touches production)

### 2. Thor's Hammer (`tests/integration/test_data/hammer_object.yml`)
- Weapon with 1d4+200 damage (201-204 per hit)
- +50 hitroll and +50 damroll modifiers
- Stored with `.yml` extension to prevent test runner from treating it as a test
- Object vnum 12001 (test-only range)

### 3. Updated Test (`tests/integration/test_experience_gain.yaml`)
- Uses `test_extensions` to load Thor's Hammer into room 1200
- Simplified from 8 steps to 6 steps
- Reduced combat time from 6s to 3s
- Now achieves 100% reliability

### 4. Documentation & Tools
- `tests/integration/test_data/README.md` - Usage guide
- `tests/integration/test_data/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical details
- `tests/test_reliability_100.sh` - Script to run 100 consecutive tests

## Test Results

### Before
- Flaky: Could fail intermittently due to combat RNG
- Multiple combat rounds required
- 6 second delays needed

### After
- 100% reliable: 80+ consecutive successful runs
- One-hit kill guaranteed
- 3 second delay sufficient
- All 79 integration tests still pass

## Security
âœ… Thor's Hammer never appears in production:
- Not in `dm-dist-alfa/lib/zones_yaml/`
- Not in `dm-dist-alfa/lib/tinyworld.obj`
- Only exists in test_data directory and temporary test_lib (deleted after tests)

## Reusability
The test_extensions framework can be used for future tests requiring:
- Overpowered weapons/armor
- Special quest items
- Heavy/light objects for weight tests
- Any test-specific objects

All without contaminating production game data.

## Files Changed
- `tools/integration_test_runner.py` - Added test_extensions framework
- `tests/integration/test_experience_gain.yaml` - Updated to use Thor's Hammer
- `tests/integration/test_data/hammer_object.yml` - New test weapon
- `tests/integration/test_data/README.md` - Documentation
- `tests/integration/test_data/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical details
- `tests/test_reliability_100.sh` - Validation script

## How to Verify
```bash
# Run the experience gain test
cd dm-dist-alfa
python3 ../tools/integration_test_runner.py ./dmserver ../tests/integration/test_experience_gain.yaml

# Run 100 times to verify reliability
cd ../tests
./test_reliability_100.sh

# Run full test suite
cd ../dm-dist-alfa
make all
```
