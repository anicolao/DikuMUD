ghoul undead red martian~
the ghastly ghoul~
A ghastly undead creature lurks here.
~
This abomination was once a red Martian, transformed by forbidden
science or ancient curses into a walking horror. Its copper-red skin
has become pale and corpse-like. Long fangs protrude from its mouth,
and its fingernails have grown into sharp claws. Its eyes glow with
dark yellow hunger as it glares at you.
