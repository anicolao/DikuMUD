This enormous sword is over six feet long and designed to be wielded one-handed by a
fifteen-foot green Martian. For a red Martian or human, it would be an unwieldy two-

This radium rifle is enormous, designed to be fired by the powerful four-armed green
Martians. The stock is reinforced to handle the recoil, and the barrel is longer than
