Than Kosis, Jeddak of Zodanga~
Than Kosis, the mighty Jeddak of Zodanga, stands here in regal authority.
~
This imposing red Martian stands tall and proud, his bearing that of absolute
authority. He wears an elaborate harness in the dark purple of Zodangan royalty,
decorated with captured gems and rare metals. His face is stern and calculating,
the face of a ruler who has held power through strength and cunning. His eyes
constantly assess threats and opportunities. As Jeddak of Zodanga, he commands
one of the most powerful military forces on Barsoom and schemes constantly to
expand his domain. His ambition knows no bounds, and he sees the marriage of
his son to Dejah Thoris as the key to dominating Helium.

sab than prince zodanga~
Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga~
Sab Than, arrogant Prince of Zodanga, stands here with evident self-importance.
~
This young red Martian prince carries himself with the confidence of privilege
and power. He is undeniably handsome and skilled with weapons, but his arrogance
mars his features. He wears a purple harness decorated with expensive ornaments,
each one a display of wealth and status. His eyes show ambition inherited from
his father and a sense of entitlement that comes from never being denied. He
sees Dejah Thoris not as a person but as a prize to be won, a means to ultimate
power. His combat skills are formidable, but he lacks the depth of character
that comes from true adversity.

zat arrras jed zodanga schemer~
Zat Arrras, Jed of Zodanga~
Zat Arrras, a scheming Jed of Zodanga, watches everything with calculating eyes.
~
This red Martian nobleman embodies political ambition and treachery. His face
is pleasant enough, but his eyes constantly calculate advantage and opportunity.
He dresses richly in purple and black, projecting an image of wealth and power.
Unlike many red Martians who pride themselves on warrior skills, Zat Arrras
excels at manipulation, political maneuvering, and backstabbing. He sees chaos
as opportunity and has no loyalty beyond his own advancement. He hates John
Carter for representing everything he is not - honor, courage, and genuine
heroism. He speaks with false courtesy while his mind plots treachery.

~
This middle-aged red Martian has the unremarkable appearance of someone you

purple harness is functional rather than ornate. His eyes, however, are sharp
and penetrating, constantly assessing and analyzing. He commands Zodanga's
vast intelligence network, with agents in every major city on Barsoom. He knows
secrets that could topple governments and end lives. His loyalty is to Zodanga
and to knowledge itself. He maintains files on nearly every important figure
on the planet.

gathering, this agent serves Zodangan intelligence in various cities. Combat

clothing that allows free movement, the assassin carries concealed weapons
