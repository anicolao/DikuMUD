Puff~
Puff, an ancient white banth, rests here contemplating mysteries.

This legendary banth is unlike any other on Mars. Its ten legs end in
massive paws, and its white fur shimmers with an otherworldly quality.
Ancient beyond measure, it seems to perceive realities beyond normal
understanding. Its leonine face holds wisdom and power in equal measure.
