Southern Concourse~
   You stand at the southern end of the bridge that extends from Lesser Helium's
wall. A small stone structure serves as a guard post and customs station for
travelers heading south. Beyond stretches the vast ochre-moss plains of the dead
sea bottom, extending to the horizon under the pale Martian sky. To the south,
barely visible in the distance, you can make out the massive silhouette of the
Atmosphere Factory.

   The ancient sea bottom extends in all directions, covered in rust-red ochre moss
