green skin and four arms of her race, but her eyes hold a compassion rarely seen among

She was the one who befriended John Carter when he first came to Mars, teaching him the
Thark language and customs. Her kindness nearly cost her life more than once, but under
her father's protection, she thrives. She wears a simple leather harness decorated with
small ornaments.

dangerous and will attack if given the chance.
