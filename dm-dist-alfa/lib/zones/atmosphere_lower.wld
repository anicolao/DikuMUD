Abandoned Maintenance Tunnel~
   You drop down through the hidden trapdoor into an abandoned maintenance tunnel. The
air here is stale and cold, untouched by the ventilation systems that serve the upper
factory. Emergency lights provide dim illumination, casting long shadows. This section
was sealed off long ago, but the passage of feet through dust suggests someone has been
using these tunnels recently.

the personal laboratory of the master behind all the experiments above - Ras Thavas himself.
The equipment here surpasses everything in the other labs, combining ancient Martian
technology with modern innovations and the researcher's own genius. This is where the most
advanced and dangerous work is performed.

equipment laboratory advanced~
The equipment in this laboratory is beyond anything you've seen elsewhere. Some devices
combine multiple technologies - biological, mechanical, and energy-based - into unified
systems. The work being done here represents the cutting edge of multiple scientific
disciplines, pushed to their absolute limits and beyond.

Observation and Planning Chamber~
   This chamber contains Ras Thavas's research notes, plans, and observations. Maps of
the factory cover one wall, marked with notations about systems and opportunities. Another
wall displays biological diagrams showing proposed modifications to Martian physiology.
A third shows energy diagrams for proposed factory enhancements. The scope of the research
is breathtaking - nothing less than remaking Mars itself.

notes plans research~
Reading through the notes reveals Ras Thavas's grand vision: extending Martian lifespans
indefinitely, enhancing physical capabilities, and improving the factory's output to support
a larger population. The goals are noble - ensuring Mars's survival. But the methods are
questionable at best, and some experiments cross lines that should never be crossed. The
moral complexity is overwhelming.

The Master's Chamber~
   This is the personal chamber of Ras Thavas, the Master Mind behind the lower level
research. The room combines laboratory, living space, and fortress. Advanced equipment
monitors multiple experiments, while defensive systems protect against intruders. Ras
Thavas himself is here, surrounded by his research, prepared to defend his work or explain
his vision - depending on your approach.

This chamber is simultaneously a place of brilliant research and dangerous obsession. Ras
Thavas has spent years here, possibly decades, pursuing knowledge that could save Mars or
damn it. The intensity of his dedication is evident in every detail, as is the single-
minded focus that has allowed him to cross ethical boundaries others wouldn't dare approach.
