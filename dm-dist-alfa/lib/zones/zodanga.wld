The Main Plaza of Zodanga~
   You stand in the central plaza of Zodanga, the great rival city of Helium.

angles dominating the design. Massive statues of Zodangan Jeddaks tower over
the plaza, their stern faces watching all who pass. Red Martian warriors in
the dark purple harnesses of Zodanga patrol constantly. The atmosphere feels
oppressive compared to the open grace of Helium.
