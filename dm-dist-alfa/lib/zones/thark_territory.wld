The Main Plaza~
   You stand in the vast main plaza of the ancient Thark city. Towering ruins
of massive stone structures surround you on all sides, their once-smooth walls
now cracked and weathered by countless Martian sandstorms. In the center of
the plaza stands a colossal statue of an ancient Thark chieftain, his four
arms raised in a gesture of defiance. Green Martian warriors mill about,
their fifteen-foot frames casting long shadows in the reddish sunlight.

room is surprisingly austere - a single massive stone throne dominates the
space, its surface worn smooth by centuries of use. Maps of Thark territory
cover one wall, marked with the positions of rival hordes and red Martian
cities. Tars Tarkas himself stands here, a towering figure of green muscle

Northern Gate - Exterior~
   You stand outside the northern gate of the Thark city. The dead sea bottom
stretches away to the north, but this direction leads toward Warhoon territory
and other hostile green Martian hordes. The Tharks maintain constant patrols in
this direction, and the ochre plains are marked with signs of recent skirmishes.
This is not a safe direction to travel without a good reason.
