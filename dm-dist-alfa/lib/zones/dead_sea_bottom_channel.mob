calot companion pet beast~
Papi's favorite calot~
Papi's favorite calot rests here, its ten legs tucked beneath it.
~
This is an exceptionally well-trained calot with sleek, hairless hide
and an unusually gentle demeanor. Despite its powerful build and the
large claws on each of its ten feet, it seems docile and affectionate.
Its frog-like head nuzzles those it trusts. Best not to anger it, though.

Henry the Gardener~
Henry the Red Martian gardener sits here, looking drunk.
~
This red Martian has copper-red skin weathered by outdoor work. Though
tall and still strong, centuries of labor have worn him down. His
expression shows deep sorrow and depression, haunted by memories of
when Mars was green and lush, before the great dying.

corpse zombie undead red martian~
the reanimated corpse~
A reanimated red Martian corpse staggers toward you.
~
This horror was once a red Martian, but now only a shambling corpse
remains. Its copper-red skin has turned gray and rotten. Ancient
Martian science or dark arts have brought it back in this terrible
state. Maggots crawl over its decaying body as it lurches forward.

ghoul undead red martian~
the ghastly ghoul~
A ghastly undead creature lurks here.
~
This abomination was once a red Martian, transformed by forbidden
science or ancient curses into a walking horror. Its copper-red skin
has become pale and corpse-like. Long fangs protrude from its mouth,
and its fingernails have grown into sharp claws. Its eyes glow with
dark yellow hunger as it glares at you.
