The Grand Entrance Hall~
   You stand within the enormous entrance hall of the Atmosphere Factory. The ceiling
soars hundreds of feet overhead, supported by massive pillars of gleaming metal that
seem to have no corrosion despite their obvious age. The constant thrum of machinery
fills the air, a deep vibration you can feel in your bones. Ancient Martian glyphs
cover the walls, and the scale of everything suggests this place was built by beings
who thought in terms of eternity.
