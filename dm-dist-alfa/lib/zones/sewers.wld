Lower Sewer Access~
   You descend through a narrow opening in the waste disposal area into the ancient
sewer tunnels beneath Lesser Helium.  The air is thick and dank, filled with the
smell of decay and stagnant water.  The walls are constructed from massive stone
blocks, covered in centuries of slime and moss.  A faint squeaking sound echoes
from deeper in the tunnels, and you can hear the rustle of unseen creatures in
the darkness.

Main Sewer Tunnel~
   This wide tunnel was once part of Lesser Helium's water reclamation system.
Water channels run along both sides, now mostly dry except for fetid pools of
stagnant liquid.  The stone walls are slick with moisture and algae.  Small bones
are scattered across the floor, and you hear the scurrying of many tiny feet in
the shadows.

Main Tunnel Junction~
   The main sewer tunnel widens here into a junction chamber.  Multiple passages
branch off in different directions.  Water drips constantly from the ceiling,
creating small pools on the uneven floor.  The walls show signs of ancient repair
work, and you can see where newer stones have been added to replace damaged
sections.  A large nest of bones and refuse has been built in one corner.

evidence of the many creatures that have died here.  Several tunnels branch off

   This western branch of the sewer system shows more signs of collapse.  Several
sections of the ceiling have fallen in, creating piles of rubble that must be

and unstable.  Fresh claw marks on the walls suggest something large patrols
