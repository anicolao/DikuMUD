Sola looks at you with her kind eyes and speaks softly. 'I see kindness in your eyes, stranger. Few show compassion to the green Martians of Thark. If you would be a friend to me and my father Tars Tarkas, simply speak with me again when you have proven yourself worthy. I will know by your deeds.'~
Sola smiles warmly at you. 'I can see you have grown stronger since we last spoke. You have the bearing of a true warrior now. Please, accept this gift from my father - his old practice sword. It served him well when he was learning the ways of the blade, and now it shall serve you. May it bring you victory in battle.'~
Sola looks at you thoughtfully. 'Perhaps another time, when you are ready.'~
