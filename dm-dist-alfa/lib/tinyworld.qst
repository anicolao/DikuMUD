Sola looks at you with her kind eyes and speaks softly. 'My father, Tars Tarkas, has asked me to find his old practice sword. It was taken by white apes during a raid on our storage chambers. If you could retrieve it and bring it back to me, I would be most grateful. The sword is very important to my father - it reminds him of when he first learned to fight. Please, will you help me?'~
Sola's eyes light up with joy as she sees the practice sword. 'You found it! My father will be so pleased. Thank you, friend. Please, keep the sword - my father would want you to have it, as a token of our friendship and gratitude.'~
Sola looks disappointed. 'I had hoped you would find my father's practice sword, but time has run out. Perhaps it is lost forever.'~
