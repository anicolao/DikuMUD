Sola looks at you with her kind eyes and speaks softly. 'White apes have been threatening our people, raiding our territory and stealing our supplies. If you would help us, go into the ancient ruins and defeat one of these beasts. Bring me a white ape tooth as proof of your deed, and my father will reward you with one of his practice swords. Will you help us?'~
Sola's eyes light up with relief and gratitude as she examines the white ape tooth. 'You have defeated one of the beasts! You have proven yourself a friend to the Tharks. My father, Tars Tarkas, would want you to have this - his old practice sword. It served him well when he was learning the blade, and now it shall serve you. May it bring you victory, warrior.'~
Sola looks disappointed. 'The white apes still threaten us. I had hoped you would help protect my people.'~
