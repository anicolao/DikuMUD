Sola looks at you with her kind eyes and speaks softly. 'White apes have been threatening our people, raiding our territory and stealing our supplies. If you would help us, go into the ancient ruins and defeat one of these beasts. Bring me a white ape tooth as proof of your deed, and my father will reward you with one of his practice swords. Will you help us?'~
Sola's eyes light up with relief and gratitude as she examines the white ape tooth. 'You have defeated one of the beasts! You have proven yourself a friend to the Tharks. My father, Tars Tarkas, would want you to have this - his old practice sword. It served him well when he was learning the blade, and now it shall serve you. May it bring you victory, warrior.'~
Sola looks disappointed. 'The white apes still threaten us. I had hoped you would help protect my people.'~

The biological researcher looks at you with concern. 'We need fresh specimens for important research. If you can bring me a preserved biological specimen from one of the containment areas, I can use it to advance our understanding of enhancement techniques. The research could save lives across Mars. Will you help?'~
The researcher examines the specimen carefully, her eyes lighting up with scientific interest. 'Perfect! This specimen will allow us to continue crucial research. Here, take this advanced healing medicine - it's one of the benefits of our work here. Thank you for your assistance.'~
The researcher sighs. 'Without proper specimens, our research will stagnate. Mars needs this knowledge to survive.'~

Vad Varo speaks to you in a hushed, urgent tone. 'I need your help. I've compiled research notes documenting the dangerous experiments happening here. Please deliver these notes to the power technician - he's one of the few who might help expose what Ras Thavas is doing. Be careful though, if Ras Thavas discovers what we're planning, we're both in grave danger. Will you help me?'~
The power technician takes the notes and nods grimly. 'This confirms what I suspected. Vad Varo is right to be concerned. Here, take this enhanced sword - you've proven yourself trustworthy and Mars may need warriors who understand the truth about this place. Be careful.'~
Vad Varo looks disappointed and worried. 'Without those notes being delivered, no one will know the truth about what's happening here. The experiments will continue unchecked.'~

The power technician speaks urgently. 'A radium mutant has escaped from one of the experimental chambers. The radiation it's emitting is destabilizing the entire power grid. You need to hunt it down and eliminate it before it causes a catastrophic failure. The creature is extremely dangerous - it was exposed to concentrated radium and transformed into something deadly. Can you handle this threat?'~
The technician breathes a sigh of relief. 'You've eliminated the mutant threat. The power systems are stabilizing. Your courage has potentially saved the entire factory - and all life on Mars that depends on it. Take this portable radium device as thanks. You've earned it.'~
The technician shakes his head gravely. 'The radium mutant is still loose. Every moment it remains active, it threatens the entire factory's stability. All of Mars could pay the price.'~

The ancient consciousness speaks to your mind. 'Young one, you seek knowledge of the ancients. Journey deep into the archive chambers where the original blueprints are stored. Simply reaching that sacred place will prove your worthiness. The knowledge there could change Mars's future - but only those with courage and determination can access it. Will you make this pilgrimage?'~
The First Engineer's presence fills your mind with approval. 'You have reached the archive chambers. You have proven yourself worthy of the ancient knowledge. Take this gift - an artifact from the original builders. Use it wisely, and remember that knowledge carries great responsibility. You now understand what few modern Martians can comprehend.'~
The ancient consciousness seems disappointed. 'You were unable to reach the archive chambers. Perhaps you are not yet ready for the knowledge of the ancients. The wisdom of the builders will remain hidden for now.'~

Ras Thavas regards you with calculating intelligence. 'You are capable, I can see that. I require an ancient data crystal from the archive levels. These crystals contain knowledge from the original factory builders - knowledge even I have not fully mastered. Retrieve one for me, and I will share knowledge with you that no other surgeon on Mars possesses. The crystals are well-guarded, but someone of your abilities should manage. Do we have an accord?'~
Ras Thavas examines the data crystal with barely contained excitement. 'Excellent! This crystal contains techniques I've been seeking for decades. You have advanced the cause of science significantly today. Here - this medical procedure manual contains my own discoveries. Study it if you have the intellect. Few do.'~
Ras Thavas looks at you with thinly veiled disappointment. 'No crystal? Then you are not as capable as I believed. The knowledge remains locked away, and Mars is poorer for it.'~
