  action_desc: "              Rules for Immortal Player Behaviour\n\nUpon becoming\
    \ immortal, you are no longer considered a player in DikuMud,\nyou simply cannot\
    \ get killed. Therefore, there are certain rules you must\nfollow. Knowingly breaking\
    \ these rules will probably cost you your\ncharacters(s).\n\n - An immortal must\
    \ not support ANY mortal playing character in the game,\n   including his/her\
    \ own caracter. Supporting includes grouping, items,\n   money, 'preparing' monsters\
    \ for easy killing, etc.\n      You may occasionally help low-level players by\
    \ giving them\n   small amounts of money or items. You may only give them what\
    \ is\n   buyable in the shops, and never more than 500 gold coins worth.\n   \
    \   Immortals are welcome to take part in the game, by creating\n   unexpected\
    \ (but never unreasonably harmful) obstacles for the players,\n   or by providing\
    \ divine assistance to a newcomer in distress. Usage\n   of the 'switch'-command\
    \ to make the monsters more challenging or\n   entertaining is also acceptable\
    \ - see the rules about harming players,\n   below.\n\n - An immortal is allowed\
    \ to play other characters, provided that he/she\n   does not support them - see\
    \ above. Beware: It is very hard not to help\n   your mortal player, and we'll\
    \ show virtually no mercy, should we find out.\n     Exception from this rule\
    \ can be made ONLY for test purposes, and only\n   by immortals who are actually\
    \ building or supervising areas of the\n   world. Other players should NEVER benefit\
    \ or suffer from this.\n   Test characters should not be a nuisance to other players\
    \ in any way.\n\n - An immortal character is not allowed to harm mortal players\n\
    \   in any way, unless this player is extremly provocative and\n   annoying to\
    \ others.\n\n   Any action taken against mortals should have a VERY good reason.\n\
    \n - Implementors of DikuMUD reserves right to change any of the\n   above rules.\n\
    \n - A frequently asked question is what to do after a game crash. In general,\n\
    \   you shouldn't do anything. However, if you feel up to it, and if you\n   feel\
    \ very confident that you aren't being cheated (grabbed by the nose,\n   as they\
    \ say in Denmark), you are allowed to make compensations for the\n   losses of\
    \ the players. Still, the rule in this case is, 'better too\n   little than too\
    \ much'.\n\n\"Any excuse is a bad excuse\" - Papi\n\nThese are just suggestions:\n\
    \n - You could hang around talking to other players.\n\n - You may apply for building\
    \ a new area in the world of DikuMud.\n   Send a letter to the Central Commitee\
    \ of DikuMud Building Junta\n   Association. This may be sent to either:\n   \
    \  Tom Madsen (noop@freja.diku.dk)\n     Michael Seifert (seifert@freja.diku.dk)\n\
    \     Sebastian Hammer (quinn@freja.diku.dk)\n   We will then return a letter\
    \ explaining the Building rules.\n\n - You may apply for World Supervisor. A supervisor\
    \ is\n   assigned an area(s) which other immortals are building. The idea\n  \
    \ is that you test the area, give ideas for changes, inform the\n   creator of\
    \ rare items which are too easy to obtain. Etc.\n   The Supervisor is \"higher\
    \ rank\" than the creator, and can always send\n   a letter to the Central Commitee\
    \ of DikuMud Building Junta Association\n   in cases of disagreement with the\
    \ creator.\n   This is a highly trusted position, and you will have to prove worthy\n\
    \   somehow.\n   For more information send a letter asking for more rules."
