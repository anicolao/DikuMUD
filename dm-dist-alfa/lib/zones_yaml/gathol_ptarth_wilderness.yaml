The route northward stretches\n    across vast dead sea bottom plains toward distant Ptarth. Gathol's scouts patrol\n    this area regularly, but beyond lies frontier territory with all its dangers.\n    The civilized world of the city lies behind; ahead waits the journey through\n    untamed Mars."

This is the reality of travel on Mars - vast empty spaces\n    between pockets of civilization."
