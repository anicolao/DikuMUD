  description: "   You stand at the northern edge of Ptarth's territory, where the city's\n    protective influence fades into the vast wilderness. The route northward\n    stretches across hundreds of miles of dead sea bottom toward distant Kaol.\n    Ptarthian scouts patrol these approaches regularly, but beyond lies dangerous\n    frontier requiring strength and skill to traverse. The comforts of civilization\n    lie behind; ahead waits the challenge of Mars' unforgiving wilderness."

  description: "   The ancient sea bed stretches endlessly in all directions, covered with the\n    reddish ochre moss that sustains much of Mars' remaining life. The terrain is\n    relatively flat but treacherous - ancient rock formations, dried channels, and\n    sudden depressions can slow or endanger the unwary traveler. The thin atmosphere\n    and harsh sun create a harsh environment that tests endurance and resolve."

Small creatures burrow in the moss, while\n    larger predators stalk through the area hunting for prey. The route northward\n    is less clearly marked here - travelers must navigate carefully using landmarks\n    and the twin moons to maintain course toward Kaol."

The journey tests resolve and endurance as\n    the distances seem endless and the harsh environment takes its toll. Only the\n    promise of Kaol ahead provides motivation to continue."
