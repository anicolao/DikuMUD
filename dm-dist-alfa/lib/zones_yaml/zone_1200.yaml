    fire

    which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  There are no doors out.  Clearly

    the owner of this room needs none.'

  description: '   You see here a cozy little room with a fireplace.  You can tell
    it is Moses''

    room by the two stone tablets and a bible on a small ledge near the fireplace.

    This room was designed for total relaxation.  You can watch television, listen

    to the stereo, even soak in a hot tub.

    There is a bell here for the butler.'

    bright

    light in all colors. You feel time and space no longer exist here.
