  long_desc: Ras Thavas stands here, radiating intelligence and obsessive dedication.
  detailed_desc: 'This elderly red Martian is perhaps the greatest scientific mind
    on Mars - and the most

    morally ambiguous. His deeply lined face shows centuries of life and intense study.
    His

    eyes are sharp and analytical, seeing everything as a problem to be solved. He
    wears a

    scientist''s harness of exceptional quality, covered with tools and instruments.
    Ras Thavas

    is a master surgeon, biologist, and engineer who has pushed the boundaries of
    science

    farther than anyone. He''s performed brain transplants, extended lifespans indefinitely,

    created hybrid life forms, and enhanced Martian capabilities. His work could save
    Mars from

    slow extinction - or destroy it through hubris. He''s not inherently evil, but
    his single-

    minded pursuit of knowledge has led him to cross ethical lines repeatedly. He''s
    incredibly

    dangerous in his own way, possessing knowledge of Martian physiology that allows
    him to

    exploit weaknesses others don''t know exist. He can be reasoned with but will
    defend his

    research if threatened.'

  quest_text: "Vad Varo speaks to you in a hushed, urgent tone. 'I need your help. I've compiled research notes documenting the dangerous experiments happening here. Please deliver these notes to the power technician - he's one of the few who might help expose what Ras Thavas is doing. Be careful though, if Ras Thavas discovers what we're planning, we're both in grave danger. Will you help me?'"
  complete_text: "The power technician takes the notes and nods grimly. 'This confirms what I suspected. Vad Varo is right to be concerned. Here, take this enhanced sword - you've proven yourself trustworthy and Mars may need warriors who understand the truth about this place. Be careful.'"
  fail_text: "Vad Varo looks disappointed and worried. 'Without those notes being delivered, no one will know the truth about what's happening here. The experiments will continue unchecked.'"

  quest_text: "The power technician speaks urgently. 'A radium mutant has escaped from one of the experimental chambers. The radiation it's emitting is destabilizing the entire power grid. You need to hunt it down and eliminate it before it causes a catastrophic failure. The creature is extremely dangerous - it was exposed to concentrated radium and transformed into something deadly. Can you handle this threat?'"
  complete_text: "The technician breathes a sigh of relief. 'You've eliminated the mutant threat. The power systems are stabilizing. Your courage has potentially saved the entire factory - and all life on Mars that depends on it. Take this portable radium device as thanks. You've earned it.'"
  fail_text: "The technician shakes his head gravely. 'The radium mutant is still loose. Every moment it remains active, it threatens the entire factory's stability. All of Mars could pay the price.'"

  quest_text: "The ancient consciousness speaks to your mind. 'Young one, you seek knowledge of the ancients. Journey deep into the archive chambers where the original blueprints are stored. Simply reaching that sacred place will prove your worthiness. The knowledge there could change Mars's future - but only those with courage and determination can access it. Will you make this pilgrimage?'"

Take this gift - an artifact from the original builders. Use it wisely, and remember that knowledge carries great responsibility. You now understand what few modern Martians can comprehend.'"
  fail_text: "The ancient consciousness seems disappointed. 'You were unable to reach the archive chambers. Perhaps you are not yet ready for the knowledge of the ancients. The wisdom of the builders will remain hidden for now.'"

  quest_text: "Ras Thavas regards you with calculating intelligence. 'You are capable, I can see that. I require an ancient data crystal from the archive levels. These crystals contain knowledge from the original factory builders - knowledge even I have not fully mastered. Retrieve one for me, and I will share knowledge with you that no other surgeon on Mars possesses. The crystals are well-guarded, but someone of your abilities should manage. Do we have an accord?'"
  complete_text: "Ras Thavas examines the data crystal with barely contained excitement. 'Excellent! This crystal contains techniques I've been seeking for decades. You have advanced the cause of science significantly today. Here - this medical procedure manual contains my own discoveries. Study it if you have the intellect. Few do.'"
  fail_text: "Ras Thavas looks at you with thinly veiled disappointment. 'No crystal? Then you are not as capable as I believed. The knowledge remains locked away, and Mars is poorer for it.'"
