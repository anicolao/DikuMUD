  quest_text: Sola looks at you with her kind eyes and speaks softly. 'White apes
    have been threatening our people, raiding our territory and stealing our supplies.
    If you would help us, go into the ancient ruins and defeat one of these beasts.
    Bring me a white ape tooth as proof of your deed, and my father will reward you
    with one of his practice swords. Will you help us?'
  complete_text: Sola's eyes light up with relief and gratitude as she examines the
    white ape tooth. 'You have defeated one of the beasts! You have proven yourself
    a friend to the Tharks. My father, Tars Tarkas, would want you to have this -
    his old practice sword. It served him well when he was learning the blade, and
    now it shall serve you. May it bring you victory, warrior.'
  fail_text: Sola looks disappointed. 'The white apes still threaten us. I had hoped
    you would help protect my people.'

  quest_text: Tars Tarkas regards you with his four arms crossed. 'You have proven
    yourself to Sola. Now prove yourself to me. Hunt the great calot in the wastes
    and bring proof of your kill. Only then will you have the respect of the Tharks.'
  complete_text: Tars Tarkas nods with approval as you report your success. 'You
    fight well, for an outsider. Take this weapon - you've earned the respect of
    the green Martians. May it serve you in battle.'
  fail_text: Tars Tarkas looks at you sternly. 'The calot still roams. Return when
    you're ready to face it.'
