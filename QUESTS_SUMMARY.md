## Potential Level Adjustments

Based on review against the character leveling guide ([docs/design/class_balance_guide.md](docs/design/class_balance_guide.md)) and actual XP requirements per level, the following observations and recommendations are made:

### XP Requirements for Reference
From the game code (constants.c), here are the XP requirements for key levels:
- Level 2: 1-2,500 XP (varies by class)
- Level 3: 2,500-5,000 XP  
- Level 4: 5,000-10,000 XP
- Level 5: 10,000-20,000 XP
- Level 10: 135,000-250,000 XP
- Level 15: 1,500,000-1,875,000 XP
- Level 20: 3,750,000-7,000,000+ XP

### Quest Balance Analysis

**Low-Level Quests (1-5): Well Balanced**
- Quest 3001 (200 XP) provides ~8% progress toward level 3 - appropriate for first combat quest
- Quest 3002 (250 XP) provides ~10% progress toward level 3 - good exploration reward
- Quest 3003 (300 XP) provides ~6% progress toward level 4 - reasonable for delivery quest
- **Status:** These quests provide meaningful progress without trivializing early leveling

**Mid-Level Quest Gap (Levels 6-10)**
- **Issue:** Large XP gap between Quest 3003 (300 XP, level 3-10) and next available quests (1,200+ XP, level 10+)
- **Impact:** Characters level 6-9 have limited quest content
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding 1-2 intermediate quests in Lesser Helium or Thark Territory
  - Suggested: Level 6-8 quest with 600-800 XP reward
  - Suggested: Level 8-10 quest with 1,000-1,200 XP reward

### Quest 4001: Sola's White Ape Tooth
**Current:** Level 10-15, 500 XP  
**Analysis:** At level 10, requires ~135,000 XP for next level. Quest provides 0.37% of level progress.
**Issue:** Very low XP reward considering white apes are dangerous enemies (level 7-10 creatures per class balance guide)
**Recommendation:** **Increase XP to 1,000-1,500** to better reflect the challenge
**Reasoning:** This is the first Thark Territory quest and involves combat with dangerous creatures. Current reward undervalues the risk and effort.

### Quest 4204: Archive Chamber Exploration  
**Current:** Level 11-13, 3,000 XP
**Analysis:** At level 12, requires ~375,000 XP for next level. Quest provides 0.8% of level progress.
**Status:** **Appropriately rewarded** for deep dungeon exploration with 4-hour time limit
**Reasoning:** Long duration and dangerous location justify high XP. No change needed.

### Quest 4205: Ras Thavas's Data Crystal
**Current:** Level 12-14, 3,500 XP  
**Analysis:** Highest XP quest reward, at level 13 provides 0.31% of level progress.
**Status:** **Appropriate for difficulty and lore significance**
**Reasoning:** Ras Thavas is a major Barsoom character. High reward justified by narrative importance and danger. However, consider if level range should be 13-15 to better match other high-reward quests.

### High-Level Quests (16-20): Generally Well Balanced
Most high-level quests provide 2,000-3,200 XP:
- Quest 3601 (3,200 XP): 0.09% of level 19 progress - appropriate for dangerous Zodanga mission
- Quest 4301 (2,500 XP): 0.07% of level 18 progress - reasonable for banth hunting
- Quest 4501 (3,000 XP): 0.08% of level 19 progress - good reward for military challenge

**Status:** High-level quest rewards are appropriately scaled. At these levels, XP primarily comes from creature kills, with quests providing supplementary rewards.

### Quest 3902: Scholar's Artifact
**Current:** Level 14-18, 1,800 XP
**Analysis:** At level 16, provides 0.1% of level progress
**Issue:** Slightly underrewarded for the level range  
**Recommendation:** Consider increasing to 2,200-2,500 XP to better match level 14-18 difficulty
**Reasoning:** Greater Helium artifact retrieval should be comparable to other mid-level retrieval quests

### Quest 3781: Jetan Tournament  
**Current:** Level 15-20, 2,000 XP
**Analysis:** At level 17, provides 0.08% of level progress
**Status:** **Adequately rewarded** for the challenge
**Reasoning:** Combat quest in allied city, reward is reasonable for difficulty level

### Atmosphere Factory Quest Cluster (Quests 4201-4205)
**Status:** **Excellent balance and progression**
- Five quests covering levels 10-14
- Progressive XP rewards: 1,500 → 2,000 → 2,500 → 3,000 → 3,500
- Creates natural quest chain encouraging zone exploration
- **No changes needed** - this is a model for quest design

### Lesser Helium Starter Quests (Quests 3001-3003)
**Status:** **Well designed for new players**
- Three quests with clear progression (200 → 250 → 300 XP)
- Cover all basic quest types (KILL, EXPLORE, DELIVERY)
- Appropriate difficulty and rewards for levels 1-10
- **No changes needed** - good introduction to quest system

### Summary of Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. **Quest 4001** (Sola's White Ape): Increase XP from 500 to 1,200-1,500
2. Add 1-2 intermediate quests for levels 6-10 (600-1,200 XP range)
