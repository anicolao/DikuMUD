# DikuMUD - Barsoom Universe

## About This Project

We plan to run an original **Gamma DikuMUD** and build a new universe based on **Barsoom** from Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Mars series. This ambitious project aims to bring the exotic world of John Carter's adventures to life in a multi-user dungeon environment.

### What is Barsoom?

Barsoom is Edgar Rice Burroughs' fictional representation of Mars, featuring:
- Diverse cultures and civilizations (Red Martians, Green Martians, and more)
- Exotic creatures and landscapes
- Ancient cities and advanced technology
- Epic adventures and heroic tales

Our goal is to create an immersive MUD experience that captures the spirit and wonder of Barsoom.
