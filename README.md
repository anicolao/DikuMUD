# DikuMUD - Barsoom Universe

## About This Project

We plan to run an original **Gamma DikuMUD** and build a new universe based on **Barsoom** from Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Mars series. This ambitious project aims to bring the exotic world of John Carter's adventures to life in a multi-user dungeon environment.

### What is Barsoom?

Barsoom is Edgar Rice Burroughs' fictional representation of Mars, featuring:
- Diverse cultures and civilizations (Red Martians, Green Martians, and more)
- Exotic creatures and landscapes
- Ancient cities and advanced technology
- Epic adventures and heroic tales

Our goal is to create an immersive MUD experience that captures the spirit and wonder of Barsoom.

## Development Tools

### Zone Layout Validator

The zone_layout_validator tool helps ensure spatial consistency in zone designs by:
- Walking through all rooms using breadth-first search
- Assigning (x, y, z) coordinates based on exit directions
- Detecting rooms with inconsistent coordinates
- Identifying overlapping rooms in the spatial layout

**Usage:**
```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
make zone_layout_validator
./zone_layout_validator           # Validate all zones
./zone_layout_validator <zone>    # Validate specific zone
```

See `dm-dist-alfa/doc/zone_layout_validator.doc` for detailed documentation.
