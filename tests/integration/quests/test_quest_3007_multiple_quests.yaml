    This test verifies that mob 3007 (Red Martian Warrior) is properly loaded 
    in the game world and can be located. This mob has 3 quests assigned:
    - Quest 3001: Guard's Training (KILL quest)
    - Quest 3002: Market Patrol (EXPLORE quest)
    - Quest 3602: Intelligence Gathering (EXPLORE quest)
    
    The test uses the wizard 'locate' command to verify the mob exists in the game.
  notes: |
    This test addresses the problem statement requirement (a): proving that a mob
    with multiple quest assignments actually works in the game.
