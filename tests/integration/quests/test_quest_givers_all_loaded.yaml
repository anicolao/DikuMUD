    Total: 21 quests across 19 quest-giving mobs
  notes: |
    This test addresses the problem statement requirement (b): verifying that
    every mob that is supposed to offer a quest is loaded at startup.
    
    If any quest giver is not loaded, the test will fail, indicating that
    players cannot access that quest in the game.
