  notes: |
    This test validates that the dot character (.) can be used as a wildcard
    that acts like a space in target matching. This allows commands like:
    - kill the.red.martian.beggar
    to work the same as:
    - kill the red martian beggar
    
    This feature makes it easier to target mobs with multi-word names without
    having to type spaces, which can be convenient in fast-paced gameplay.
