  notes: |
    This test demonstrates the start_room feature of the integration test framework.
    The player is created with load_room set to 3014 (Market Plaza), so they start
    directly in that room without needing to navigate.
    
    This validates:
    - Player file creation with custom start_room works
    - Player starts in the specified room
    - Player can interact with room objects (fountain)
    
    Note: The test uses loose pattern matching because the exact server output
    may vary. The key is demonstrating that the start_room feature works and
    the player can execute commands in that room.
