# Sewers Zone Object Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

Several objects in the sewers zone couldn't be picked up, including:
- Leather water flask (vnum 3217)
- Moldy bread (vnum 3216) carried by one of the birds

These objects were supposed to be tested by the zone object regression tests, but they were being skipped.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Missing ITEM_TAKE Flag

Many objects in the sewers zone had `wear_flags: 0`, which meant they were missing the ITEM_TAKE flag (value 1). Without this flag, objects cannot be picked up by players.

**Objects affected:**
- 3215: dried meat (FOOD)
- 3216: moldy bread (FOOD)
- 3217: water flask (DRINKCON)
- 3218: small pouch (MONEY)
- 3221: iron key (KEY)
- 3223: healing salve (LIGHT)
- 3224: rope (LIGHT)

### Missing ITEM_HOLD Flag for Lights

Two light objects were missing the ITEM_HOLD flag (value 16384), preventing them from being held:
- 3214: radium lamp (LIGHT)
- 3225: oil lantern (LIGHT)

### Test Generator Limitations

The zone object test generator only tested:
- Weapons (type 5 with WIELD flag)
- Armor (type 9 with wear location flags)
- Shields (WEAR_SHIELD flag)
- Lights (type 1 with HOLD flag)

It was missing support for:
- Food (type 11)
- Drink containers (type 17)
- Keys (type 18)
- Containers (type 12, 15)
- Money/treasure (type 8, 16)

### No Coverage Validation

There was no validation to ensure all objects in a zone were being tested, making it easy for objects to be silently skipped.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Object Flags in sewers.yaml

Updated 9 objects to add the ITEM_TAKE flag (wear_flags: 1):
- 3215: dried meat
- 3216: moldy bread âœ…
- 3217: water flask âœ…
- 3218: small pouch
- 3221: iron key
- 3223: healing salve
- 3224: rope

Updated 2 lights to add ITEM_TAKE | ITEM_HOLD flags (wear_flags: 16385):
- 3214: radium lamp
- 3225: oil lantern

### 2. Extended Test Generator

**File: `tools/generate_zone_object_tests.py`**

Added support for additional object types:
- ITEM_FOOD (11)
- ITEM_CONTAINER (12)
- ITEM_CONTAINER_LOCKABLE (15)
- ITEM_MONEY (16)
- ITEM_DRINKCON (17)
- ITEM_KEY (18)

For these object types, the test:
1. Loads the object
2. Picks it up (`get all`)
3. Drops it
4. Purges it (cleanup)

### 3. Added Coverage Validation

The test generator now:
- Tracks all objects in the zone
- Tracks which objects are tested
- Reports objects skipped due to missing ITEM_TAKE flag
- Calculates coverage percentage
- Provides summary statistics

Output example:
```
Processing Sewers...
  Created test: test_zone_31_sewers_objects.yaml
    31 objects to test (out of 31 total objects)
```

### 4. Created Validation Tool

**File: `tools/validate_object_coverage.py`**

This tool validates that all objects in each zone are covered by tests:
- Checks each zone YAML against its test file
- Reports coverage percentage per zone
- Lists zones with 100% coverage
- Identifies zones with incomplete coverage
- Can be used in CI/CD to ensure coverage doesn't regress

## Results

### Before Fix
- **Sewers zone**: 13/31 objects tested (41.9% coverage)
- Water flask and moldy bread could not be picked up
- No validation of object coverage

### After Fix
- **Sewers zone**: 31/31 objects tested (100% coverage) âœ…
- Water flask and moldy bread can be picked up âœ…
- Coverage validation ensures no objects are missed âœ…
- Test passes with 155 steps

### Verification

Manual test confirmed:
```
âœ“ Load water flask (3217)
âœ“ Pick up water flask - SUCCESS
âœ“ Verify in inventory - FOUND
âœ“ Drop and purge - SUCCESS

âœ“ Load moldy bread (3216)
âœ“ Pick up moldy bread - SUCCESS
âœ“ Verify in inventory - FOUND
âœ“ Drop and purge - SUCCESS
```

## Impact on Other Zones

The improvements to the test generator increased coverage across all zones:

| Zone | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Sewers | 13 | 31 | +18 objects (+138%) |
| Lesser Helium | 47 | 59 | +12 objects (+26%) |
| Dead Sea Bottom | 10 | 19 | +9 objects (+90%) |
| Greater Helium | 71 | 96 | +25 objects (+35%) |
| Overall | ~240 | ~302 | +62 objects (+26%) |

**Overall game coverage**: 302/469 objects (64.4%)

**Zones with 100% coverage**:
- Sewers (31/31) ðŸŽ¯
- Gathol (2/2)
- Ptarth (2/2)
- Kaol (2/2)

## Files Modified

1. `dm-dist-alfa/lib/zones_yaml/sewers.yaml` - Fixed object flags
2. `tools/generate_zone_object_tests.py` - Extended test generator
3. `tests/integration/zones/test_zone_31_sewers_objects.yaml` - Regenerated test
4. `tests/integration/zones/*.yaml` - All zone tests regenerated with new coverage
5. `docs/testing/ZONE_OBJECT_TESTS.md` - Updated documentation
6. `tools/validate_object_coverage.py` - New validation tool

## Future Work

### Incomplete Coverage Zones

Several zones still have incomplete coverage due to objects missing ITEM_TAKE flags:

- Southern Approach: 50.0% (11 objects missing ITEM_TAKE)
- Dead Sea Wilderness: 36.8% (many objects)
- Zodanga: 42.3% (15 objects)
- Atmosphere Factory: 30.8% (16 objects)
- Atmosphere Lower: 15.4% (19 objects)

These zones should be reviewed and fixed using the same approach as sewers.

### Test Enhancement

Consider adding tests for:
- Object values (damage for weapons, AC for armor)
- Drink container capacity and liquid types
- Food nutrition values
- Container capacity
- Key compatibility with locks

## Lessons Learned

1. **Validation is critical**: Without coverage validation, objects were silently skipped
2. **Be comprehensive**: Test all object types, not just the common ones
3. **Automate checking**: Manual review would have missed these issues
4. **Document coverage**: Clear metrics help identify problems
5. **Test data matters**: Game objects need correct flags to work properly
