# Zone Object Integration Tests

## Overview

This document describes the zone object integration tests that validate all objects in each zone are properly configured and can be used as intended.

## Test Strategy

Each zone has one comprehensive integration test that validates all usable objects in the zone:

1. **Weapons** - Can be wielded
2. **Armor** - Can be worn on appropriate body locations
3. **Shields** - Can be worn/used
4. **Lights** - Can be held
5. **Food** - Can be picked up and dropped
6. **Drink Containers** - Can be picked up and dropped
7. **Keys** - Can be picked up and dropped
8. **Containers** - Can be picked up and dropped
9. **Treasure/Money** - Can be picked up and dropped

For each object, the test performs the complete workflow:
1. Load the object (wizard command)
2. Pick up the object (`get all`)
3. Use the object appropriately (`wield`, `wear`, `hold`, etc.) - if applicable
4. Remove the object - if it was used
5. Drop the object
6. Purge the object (cleanup)

## Test Generation

Tests are automatically generated using `tools/generate_zone_object_tests.py`:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/DikuMUD/DikuMUD
python3 tools/generate_zone_object_tests.py
```

This script:
- Analyzes all zone YAML files
- Identifies all takeable objects (weapons, armor, shields, lights, food, drinks, keys, containers, etc.)
- Generates appropriate test steps for each object
- Reports objects missing ITEM_TAKE flag that should be pickable
- Provides coverage statistics (objects tested vs total objects)

## Test Results

## Key Features

### 1. Reliable Room Selection

All tests start in room 1200 (The Chat Room), which is:
- Always lit (no dark room issues)
- Isolated (no mob interference)
- Reliable (no random events or wandering NPCs)

### 2. Intelligent Keyword Selection

The test generator uses a smart algorithm to select keywords:
- Prefers keywords unique to each object (avoids zone-wide generic terms like "zodangan" or "factory")
- Analyzes all objects in the zone to avoid ambiguous keywords
- Prioritizes keywords that appear in the object's short description
- Ensures only one object is loaded at a time for reliable testing

### 3. Proper Object Validation

The test generator filters out broken objects:
- Skips armor with only HOLD flags (not wearable)
- Validates that lights have HOLD flags
- Ensures weapons have WIELD flags
- Checks that armor has actual wear location flags

### 3. Wizard Character Requirements

Wizard characters (level 34) need:
- âœ… Maximum strength (18/100) to wield heavy weapons
- âœ… Access to `load obj` command
- âœ… Access to `purge` command
- âœ… Start in room 1200 (The Chat Room) - isolated, always lit, no mob interference

These requirements are met by the updated `tools/create_test_player.c`.

## File Locations

### Test Files
- Tests: `tests/integration/zones/test_zone_*_objects.yaml`
- Test outputs: `dm-dist-alfa/integration_test_outputs/zones/`

### Source Code
- Test generator: `tools/generate_zone_object_tests.py`
- Test player creator: `tools/create_test_player.c`

### Build System
- Makefile updated to create `integration_test_outputs/zones` directory
- Tests run automatically with `make integration_tests`

```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
make integration_tests
```

### Run Specific Zone Test
```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
make integration_test_outputs/zones/test_zone_37_gathol_objects.out
```

### Manual Test Run

cd dm-dist-alfa
python3 ../tools/integration_test_runner.py ./dmserver \
  ../tests/integration/zones/test_zone_37_gathol_objects.yaml
```

```

## Test Coverage

Total zones analyzed: 18
- Tests created: 13
- **Tests passing: 13** âœ… (100% pass rate!)
- Tests failing: 0

Total objects across all zones: **469 objects**
Total objects tested: **302 objects**
**Overall coverage: 64.4%**

**Perfect Coverage Zones** (100%):
- **Sewers** (31/31 objects) ðŸŽ¯
- Gathol (2/2 objects)
- Ptarth (2/2 objects)  
- Kaol (2/2 objects)

**Key Improvements**:
- All tests use room 1200 (The Chat Room) for reliability
- Smart keyword selection avoids ambiguous object targeting
- Proper object validation filters out broken items
- Extended coverage for food, drink containers, keys, containers, money, and treasure items
- Coverage validation reports objects tested vs total objects per zone

## Known Data Issues Found and Fixed

The test suite has identified and helped fix several data issues:

### Fixed in Sewers Zone âœ…
- **Water flask (3217)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Moldy bread (3216)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up  
- **Dried meat (3215)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Small pouch (3218)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Iron key (3221)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Healing salve (3223)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Rope (3224)**: Missing ITEM_TAKE flag - Fixed! Now can be picked up
- **Radium lamp (3214)**: Missing ITEM_HOLD flag - Fixed! Now can be held as a light
- **Oil lantern (3225)**: Missing ITEM_HOLD flag - Fixed! Now can be held as a light

### Still Broken
- **Object 3742** (shoulder pauldrons in Greater Helium): Has ITEM_HOLD flag instead of armor wear flags, making it unwearable. This object is filtered out by the test generator.

## Future Improvements

1. **Fix Remaining Data Issues**: 
   - Update broken objects like the pauldrons to have correct flags
   - Review and fix objects in zones with incomplete coverage
   - Add ITEM_TAKE flags to appropriate objects in other zones
2. **Add Object Type Coverage**: Consider adding tests for scrolls, potions, wands, etc.
3. **Performance**: Optimize tests to run faster (currently each object takes ~2 seconds)
4. **Extended Validation**: Test object values (damage, armor class, light duration, container capacity, etc.)

## Impact

These tests provide:
- **Validation** that all zone objects are properly configured
- **Early detection** of broken items before players encounter them
- **Documentation** of which objects exist in each zone
- **Confidence** when modifying object flags or wear locations
- **Regression protection** when making changes to equipment systems

The tests have already identified and helped fix several issues:
- Warrior harness wear flags
- Shield wear messages
- Wizard character strength for heavy weapons
- **9 objects in Sewers zone** missing ITEM_TAKE or ITEM_HOLD flags
- **Test coverage validation** now ensures all objects are accounted for
