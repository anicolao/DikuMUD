# DikuMUD System Design Analysis

## Overview

DikuMUD is a classic Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game from the early 1990s, representing a significant piece of gaming history. The codebase consists of approximately 28,000 lines of C code spread across 41 source files and 9 header files, plus extensive data files that define the game world. This document analyzes the design principles, architecture, and extension points of the original codebase to understand how it can be reused and extended.

## Core Architecture

### Event-Driven Game Loop

The system operates on a single-threaded, event-driven game loop architecture centered in `comm.c`:

**Main Game Loop** (`game_loop` in `comm.c`):
- Processes network I/O from multiple connected players using select() for non-blocking socket operations
- Runs at approximately 4 ticks per second (250ms intervals)
- Orchestrates periodic updates: zone resets, combat resolution, character regeneration, mobile AI, weather
- Handles player input parsing and command execution
- Manages output buffering and transmission to all connected clients

The game loop is the heartbeat of the entire system, coordinating all subsystems through periodic function calls at different intervals defined by pulse constants (PULSE_ZONE, PULSE_MOBILE, PULSE_VIOLENCE).

### Module Organization

The codebase is organized into functional modules, each handling a specific aspect of the game:

**Core Engine Modules:**
- `comm.c` - Network communication, socket management, and main game loop
- `db.c` - Database loading, world initialization, and data file parsing
- `interpreter.c` - Command parsing, dispatch, and player input handling
- `handler.c` - Object/character manipulation utilities and game state management
- `fight.c` - Combat system and damage calculation
- `limits.c` - Character stat limits, regeneration, and experience/leveling

**Command Handler Modules:**
- `act.comm.c` - Communication commands (say, tell, shout)
- `act.informative.c` - Information commands (look, score, inventory)
- `act.movement.c` - Movement commands and navigation
- `act.obj1.c` / `act.obj2.c` - Object interaction commands (get, drop, wear, wield)
- `act.offensive.c` - Combat-initiation commands (kill, bash, kick)
- `act.other.c` - Miscellaneous player actions

- `modify.c` - Runtime text editing and system load monitoring

### Data Structures

**Core Data Structures** (defined in `structs.h`):

**Character Data** (`struct char_data`):
- Represents both player characters and NPCs (mobiles)
- Contains abilities (strength, dexterity, etc.), hit points, mana, movement
- Tracks position, fighting status, affected spells, equipment worn
- Maintains skill levels, experience, class, level
- Links to room location, inventory, and followers/leader
- Players have additional data stored in `struct char_file_u` for persistence

**Object Data** (`struct obj_data`):
- Represents all items in the game world
- Contains type (weapon, armor, potion, container, etc.)
- Stores value fields (meaning varies by type), weight, cost
- Tracks extra flags (magical, cursed, invisible) and wear positions
- Maintains affect modifiers (stat bonuses/penalties)
- Tracks current location (carried by, worn by, in room, in container)

**Room Data** (`struct room_data`):
- Represents locations in the game world
- Contains name, description, zone number
- Defines exits to other rooms (up to 6 directions)
- Stores sector type (city, forest, water, etc.)
- Tracks room flags (dark, no-mob, death trap, private)
- Lists characters and objects present
- Can have special procedures attached

**Zone Data** (`struct zone_data`):
- Defines autonomous regions of the game world
- Contains reset commands that repopulate the zone
- Specifies reset frequency and conditions
- Commands can spawn mobs, create objects, open/close doors, set object states

**Index Data** (`struct index_data`):
- Maps virtual numbers to actual game objects
- Provides templates for creating mob and object instances
- Stores function pointers for special procedures
- Enables efficient lookup and instantiation

## Extension Points

DikuMUD's architecture provides several well-defined extension points:

### 1. Command System Extension Point

**Location:** `interpreter.c` - `assign_command_pointers()` function

**Mechanism:** The command system uses a table-driven approach with the COMMANDO macro. Each command entry specifies:
- Command number (index)
- Minimum character position required (dead, sleeping, resting, standing, fighting)
- Function pointer to command implementation
- Minimum god level required (0 for mortals, 21+ for immortals)

**How to Extend:**
To add new commands:
1. Implement command function with signature: `void do_command(struct char_data *ch, char *argument, int cmd)`
2. Register in command table using COMMANDO macro
3. Add command string to command name lookup table

The interpreter uses fuzzy matching (prefix matching) for command names, so "n" matches "north", "inv" matches "inventory", etc.

### 2. Special Procedure Extension Point

**Location:** `spec_assign.c` - Assignment functions, `spec_procs.c` - Implementations

**Mechanism:** Special procedures are function pointers attached to mobs, objects, or rooms. They execute custom logic at specific game events.

**Special Procedure Signature:**
```
int special_proc(struct char_data *ch, int cmd, char *arg)
```

Returns TRUE to block normal command processing, FALSE to allow it.

**Types of Special Procedures:**
- **Mobile Specials:** NPC behaviors (guards, shopkeepers, guild masters, aggressive mobs)
- **Object Specials:** Unique item behaviors (sentient weapons, magical fountains)
- **Room Specials:** Location-based effects (training rooms, guild halls, magic zones)

**How to Extend:**
1. Implement special procedure function in `spec_procs.c`
2. Assign to entity virtual number in `spec_assign.c` using:
   - `mob_index[real_mobile(vnum)].func = procedure_name;` for mobs
   - `obj_index[real_object(vnum)].func = procedure_name;` for objects
   - `world[real_room(vnum)].funct = procedure_name;` for rooms

Called at various points: before command execution, during mobile AI, on object interaction.

### 3. Spell System Extension Point

**Location:** `spell_parser.c` - Spell registration, `spells1.c`/`spells2.c` - Implementations

**Mechanism:** Data-driven spell system using SPELLO macro for spell definitions.

**Spell Definition Parameters:**
- Spell number (index in spell array)
- Combat delay (beats/rounds)
- Minimum position to cast
- Minimum magic user level
- Minimum cleric level  
- Mana cost
- Target types (self, character, object, room)
- Implementation function pointer

**How to Extend:**
1. Implement spell function with signature: `void cast_spell(byte level, struct char_data *ch, char *arg, int type, struct char_data *tar_ch, struct obj_data *tar_obj)`
2. Register spell using SPELLO macro in `assign_spell_pointers()`
3. Add spell name to spells[] string array
4. Optionally add to scroll/wand/staff/potion object types in data files

The spell parser handles:
- Mana checking and consumption
- Target validation and selection
- Saving throws (in spell implementations)
- Duration/affect management

### 4. Shop System Extension Point

**Location:** `shop.c` - Shop mechanics, data files - Shop definitions

**Mechanism:** Data-driven shop system loaded from `.shp` files. Shops are associated with specific keeper mobs and rooms.

**Shop Properties (configurable per shop):**
- Items produced (virtual numbers of items for sale)
- Buy/sell profit margins (price multipliers)
- Item types traded (what keeper will buy)
- Trade restrictions (who can trade - alignment, race, class)
- Operating hours (time-of-day when shop is open)
- Keeper temperament (reactions to broke customers or combat)
- Custom messages (for various transaction outcomes)

**How to Extend:**
1. Create shop definition in `.shp` data file
2. Create keeper mob in `.mob` file with shopkeeper flag
3. Shop system automatically handles: price calculation, inventory management, keeper dialogue

No C code changes needed for new shops - entirely data-driven.

### 5. Combat Message Extension Point

**Location:** `fight.c` - Message loading, `lib/messages` data file

**Mechanism:** Damage messages are loaded from a text file at boot time. Different message sets for:
- Different attack types (hit, pierce, slash, bite, etc.)
- Different damage ranges (miss, barely hit, hard hit, massacre)
- Different perspectives (attacker sees, victim sees, room sees)

**How to Extend:**
Add message groups to `lib/messages` file following format:
```
M
<attack_type>
<damage_low> <damage_high>
<attacker_message>
<victim_message>
<room_message>
```

Entirely data-driven - no code changes required for new combat messages.

### 6. Social/Emote Extension Point

**Location:** `act.social.c` - Social command processing, `lib/actions` - Social definitions

**Mechanism:** Social commands (emotes) are loaded from a data file. Each social has multiple message variants:
- No target (you smile)
- Self as target (you smile at yourself)  
- Target present (you smile at Bob)
- Target not found (smile at who?)

**How to Extend:**
Add social definitions to `lib/actions` file. Format specifies command name and message variants for each scenario. The system automatically registers and handles all defined socials.

Data-driven - no C code changes needed for new socials.

### 7. Zone Reset System Extension Point

**Location:** `db.c` - Zone reset processing, `.zon` files - Reset definitions

**Mechanism:** Zone reset commands are loaded from `.zon` files and executed periodically. Commands define how zones repopulate after being explored/cleared.

**Reset Command Types:**
- `M` - Load mobile to room
- `O` - Load object to room
- `P` - Put object in container
- `G` - Give object to last loaded mobile
- `E` - Equip object on last loaded mobile
- `D` - Set door state (open/closed/locked)
- `R` - Remove object from room

**How to Extend:**
Modify `.zon` files to define new reset sequences. Each command specifies:
- Command type
- If-flag (only execute if previous command succeeded)
- Max existing (don't spawn if this many already exist in world/zone)
- Virtual numbers of entities involved
- Additional parameters (room numbers, equipment slots, etc.)

The reset system enables complex, dynamic world population without code changes.

### 8. Help System Extension Point

**Location:** `db.c` - Help loading, `lib/help` - Help text, `act.informative.c` - Help command

**Mechanism:** Context-sensitive help loaded from text file. Help entries indexed by keywords.

**How to Extend:**
Add help entries to `lib/help` file using format:
```
<keyword1> <keyword2> ...
<help text>
<help text continues>
#
```

Help is searchable by any keyword. Players use `help <topic>` command. System performs fuzzy matching on keywords.

Data-driven - no code changes needed.

- Data: Spell availability in items (scrolls, wands, potions in .obj files)

**Special Procedures:**
- C code: Special procedure implementations (behavior logic)
- Data: Assignment of procedures to specific entities by virtual number
- Examples: shopkeepers (fully data shop + C procedure), guild guards, city guards, special mob AI

**Command System:**
- C code: Command implementations and dispatch
- Data: None directly, but commands often operate on data-driven entities

**Combat System:**
- C code: Hit/damage calculation, combat rounds, weapon effects
- Data: Combat messages, weapon statistics in objects, mobile combat stats

## Key Subsystems

### 1. Database & World Loading System

**Purpose:** Initialize the game world by loading and parsing all data files at server startup.

**Architecture:**

The `boot_db()` function in `db.c` orchestrates the loading process:

1. **Time Initialization:** Restore or initialize game time from file
2. **Static Text Loading:** Read motd, news, credits, info, wizlist into memory
3. **File Opening:** Open mob, object, help, and world files
4. **Zone Loading:** Parse zone files for reset commands and zone metadata
5. **World Loading:** Parse room definitions and build world array
6. **Index Generation:** Build lookup tables for mobs and objects by virtual number
7. **Renumbering:** Convert virtual numbers to array indices for fast runtime access
8. **Player Index:** Build index of all player characters in player file
9. **Message Loading:** Load combat messages, socials, pose messages
10. **Procedure Assignment:** Attach special procedures to entities
11. **Initial Reset:** Execute boot-time reset of all zones to populate world

**Virtual Number System:**
- Data files reference entities by virtual numbers (designer-assigned IDs)
- Virtual numbers enable distributed development (different zones use different number ranges)
- At boot, virtual numbers are converted to array indices for O(1) lookup
- Functions `real_mobile()`, `real_object()`, `real_room()` perform virtual-to-real translation
- Uses binary search on sorted arrays for translation

**Data File Format Characteristics:**
- Text-based files (ASCII)
- Record-oriented with # prefixes for new records
- ~ terminators for text fields
- Fields on separate lines
- Comments possible (ignored lines)
- $ terminates some files

**Extension Strategy:** 
To add new data sources:
1. Create parser function following pattern of `parse_room()`, `parse_mobile()`, etc.
2. Add call in `boot_db()` sequence
3. Allocate/populate appropriate data structure
4. Build index if using virtual numbers

### 2. Command Interpreter System

**Purpose:** Parse player input and dispatch to appropriate command handlers.

**Architecture:**

The interpreter operates in layers:

**Layer 1: Input Processing** (`nanny()` function in comm.c)
- Handles connection states: name entry, password, character creation, menu
- State machine based on descriptor->connected value
- Routes connected players to command interpreter

**Layer 2: Command Parsing** (`command_interpreter()` in interpreter.c)
- Extracts command word and arguments from input
- Performs alias expansion (not implemented in original, but extension point exists)
- Handles special cases: socials, movement directions
- Looks up command in command table

**Layer 3: Command Dispatch**
- Validates minimum position (can't fight while sleeping)
- Checks god level (permission system)
- Calls special procedures first (allows mobs/objects/rooms to intercept commands)
- If special returns FALSE, executes normal command function
- Command functions have signature: `void do_cmd(struct char_data *ch, char *argument, int cmd)`

**Command Table:**
- Array of `struct command_info` indexed by command number
- Each entry: function pointer, min position, min level, hide flag
- Parallel array of command names for lookup
- Uses search_block() for fuzzy matching (prefix matching)

**Argument Parsing:**
- `argument_interpreter()` - Extracts meaningful words, skips filler words (the, a, in, etc.)
- `one_argument()` - Extracts single argument from string
- `two_arguments()` - Extracts two arguments
- `half_chop()` - Splits string on first word

**Direction Handling:**
- Movement commands (n, s, e, w, u, d) handled specially
- Abbreviations supported (north, n, nor all work)
- Triggers `do_move()` with direction parameter

**Social Command Integration:**
- If command not found in main table, checks social table
- Socials execute without special permissions
- Social message formatting handles target variations

### 3. Combat System

**Purpose:** Resolve physical conflicts between characters.

**Architecture:**

**Combat Initiation:**
- Commands like `kill`, `hit`, `bash`, `kick` start combat
- Sets victim->specials.fighting and attacker->specials.fighting
- Adds both to global combat_list for round processing

**Combat Rounds:** (executed in `perform_violence()` called from main loop)
- Iterates through combat_list every PULSE_VIOLENCE (12 game ticks)
- Each fighting character gets one attack per round
- Attack resolution:
  1. Check if combatants still present and fighting
  2. Check for special combat procedures
  3. Calculate hit chance (thaco-based system)
  4. Roll d20, apply modifiers
  5. Compare to target AC
  6. On hit: calculate damage, apply DR, call damage()
  7. On miss: display miss message

**Damage Resolution:**
- `damage()` function in fight.c applies damage
- Reduces victim hit points
- Updates position (standing → fighting → wounded → dead)
- Checks for death: calls `die()`, generates corpse, transfers equipment
- Handles experience gain for kills
- Manages group experience sharing

**Attack Types:**
- Barehanded (hit)
- Weapon-based (pierce, slash, bludgeon based on weapon type)
- Special (bite, claw for mobs)
- Spells (magic missile, fireball, etc.)

**Weapon System:**
- Weapons are objects with type ITEM_WEAPON
- Value fields define: dice for damage, weapon type, magic bonus
- Weapon type determines messages and sometimes special effects

**Combat Messages:**
- Loaded from lib/messages file
- Organized by attack type and damage amount
- Three variants: attacker, victim, observer
- Selected based on damage dealt

**Special Combat Behaviors:**
- Fleeing: `do_flee()` attempts escape, may fail
- Bash: knockdown attack, victim loses next attack
- Kick: extra damage attack
- Backstab: special attack for thieves, multiplied damage from hiding

**Combat Modifiers:**
- Strength: damage bonus/penalty
- Dexterity: AC and hit bonus
- Armor: reduces damage
- Weapon skill: hit bonus (basic implementation)
- Position: penalty for sitting/resting
- Blindness, magic affects: various modifiers

### 4. Object System

**Purpose:** Manage all items in the game world.

**Architecture:**

**Object Lifecycle:**

1. **Creation:**
   - `read_object()` - Creates from template during zone reset
   - `clone_object()` - Duplicates existing object
   - `create_money()` - Special case for gold coins
   - Allocated from memory, added to global object_list

2. **Location Management:**
   - Objects tracked by location: in_room, carried_by, worn_by, in_obj (container)
   - Movement functions maintain consistency:
     - `obj_from_room()` / `obj_to_room()` - Room placement
     - `obj_from_char()` / `obj_to_char()` - Inventory
     - `obj_from_obj()` / `obj_to_obj()` - Container manipulation
     - `equip_char()` / `unequip_char()` - Equipment slots

3. **Destruction:**
   - `extract_obj()` - Removes from game
   - Recursively extracts contents of containers
   - Removes from all lists
   - Frees memory

**Object Types:** (ITEM_* constants)

Each type uses value[] array differently:

- **ITEM_LIGHT:** value[2] = hours of light remaining
- **ITEM_SCROLL/WAND/STAFF/POTION:** value[0] = level, value[1-3] = spell numbers
- **ITEM_WEAPON:** value[0] = unused, value[1] = number of dice, value[2] = size of dice, value[3] = weapon type
- **ITEM_ARMOR:** value[0] = AC apply
- **ITEM_CONTAINER:** value[0] = capacity, value[1] = container flags, value[2] = key vnum, value[3] = unused
- **ITEM_DRINKCON:** value[0] = capacity, value[1] = current amount, value[2] = liquid type, value[3] = is poisoned
- **ITEM_FOOD:** value[0] = hours of hunger satisfied, value[3] = is poisoned
- **ITEM_MONEY:** value[0] = number of gold coins

**Object Affects:**
- Objects can apply modifiers to wearer: +STR, +DEX, +HP, +AC, etc.
- Defined in obj->affected[] array
- Applied when equipped, removed when unequipped
- `affect_modify()` in handler.c applies/removes affects

**Object Flags:**
- Extra flags: GLOW, HUM, INVISIBLE, MAGIC, CURSED, NODROP, etc.
- Wear flags: where object can be worn/wielded
- Anti-flags: class/alignment restrictions

**Container System:**
- Containers hold other objects (in_obj links)
- Can be closed/locked (requires key object)
- Weight calculated recursively
- Can have capacity limits

**Equipment Slots:**
- Characters have array of equipment pointers
- Slots: finger (2), neck (2), body, head, legs, feet, hands, arms, shield, about, waist, wrist (2), wield, hold
- One item per slot (except explicitly multiple)
- Equipment automatically removed before new item can be worn in slot

### 5. Spell and Magic System

**Purpose:** Implement magical effects and spell casting.

**Architecture:**

**Spell Casting Flow:**

1. **Command Entry:** Player types `cast 'spell name' [target]`
2. **Parsing:** `do_cast()` in act.offensive.c/act.other.c
3. **Spell Lookup:** Find spell by name in spells[] array
4. **Validation:**
   - Check if character knows spell (class-appropriate)
   - Check if high enough level
   - Check if enough mana
   - Validate target type (self, other, object, fighting)
5. **Casting:**
   - `say_spell()` - Display spell words to room
   - Deduct mana
   - Add casting delay (character can't act for N beats)
6. **Execution:**
   - Call spell function pointer from spell_info[] table
   - Pass caster, target(s), level
7. **Effect Application:**
   - Spell function calculates effect
   - Applies damage, healing, or affects
   - Displays messages

**Spell Information Table:**
- Indexed by spell number (TYPE_* constants)
- Per spell: function pointer, mana cost, min level (MU and Cleric), targets, position, beats
- Populated by SPELLO macro in `assign_spell_pointers()`

**Spell Targets:**
- TAR_IGNORE: no target needed
- TAR_CHAR_ROOM: character in same room
- TAR_CHAR_WORLD: any character in world
- TAR_FIGHT_SELF: must be fighting
- TAR_FIGHT_VICT: must be fighting, targets opponent
- TAR_SELF_ONLY: can only target self
- TAR_OBJ_INV: object in inventory
- TAR_OBJ_ROOM: object in room
- TAR_OBJ_WORLD: any object
- TAR_OBJ_EQUIP: object equipped

**Affect System:**
- Spells can apply temporary affects to characters
- `struct affected_type` defines affect: duration, modifiers, bitvector
- Linked list per character: ch->affected
- Applied with `affect_to_char()`, removed with `affect_from_char()`
- Duration decrements each tick in `affect_update()`
- When expires, displays wear-off message

**Spell Categories:**

- **Offensive:** damage spells (magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt)
- **Healing:** restore hit points (cure light, cure critic, heal)
- **Protective:** buffs (armor, bless, sanctuary, protection from evil)
- **Debuff:** harmful affects (curse, blindness, poison, sleep)
- **Detection:** reveal hidden things (detect invisible, detect magic, sense life)
- **Utility:** various effects (teleport, summon, locate object, create food/water)
- **Enchantment:** permanent object modification (enchant weapon)

**Mana System:**
- Characters have mana pool (ch->points.mana)
- Max mana based on level and intelligence
- Regenerates over time in `point_update()` (limits.c)
- Mana cost scales with spell level and character level
- Formula: `MAX(base_cost, 100/(2+char_level-spell_level))`

**Spell Learning:**
- Characters "know" spells appropriate to their class
- Magic users learn different spells than clerics
- Spell progression defined in spell_info[] (min_level_magic, min_level_cleric)
- Skill-based system exists but limited in original

**Magic Items:**
- Scrolls: contain spells, destroyed when read
- Wands/Staves: contain spells, have charges
- Potions: spell effects when quaffed
- All use `do_use()` command with validation

### 6. Mobile (NPC) AI System

**Purpose:** Provide autonomous behavior for non-player characters.

**Architecture:**

**AI Update Cycle:** (`mobile_activity()` in mobact.c)
- Called every PULSE_MOBILE (40 game ticks)
- Iterates all NPCs in game
- Executes behavior for each awake, non-fighting mob

**Behavior Priority:**

1. **Special Procedures:** If mob has ACT_SPEC flag
   - Calls mob's special procedure function first
   - If returns TRUE, skips remaining AI
   - Enables unique behaviors (shopkeepers, guild masters, quest givers)

2. **Scavenger Behavior:** If mob has ACT_SCAVENGER flag
   - Looks for objects in room
   - Picks up most valuable item
   - Simulates greedy/hoarding behavior

3. **Aggressive Behavior:** If mob has ACT_AGGRESSIVE flag
   - Attacks random player in room
   - Checks alignment restrictions (AGGRESSIVE_EVIL, AGGRESSIVE_GOOD, etc.)

4. **Random Movement:** If not ACT_SENTINEL
   - 1 in 8 chance to move random direction
   - Won't enter NO_MOB or DEATH rooms
   - Remembers last direction to avoid backtracking

5. **Memory System:** If mob has ACT_MEMORY flag
   - Remembers players who attacked it
   - Will hunt and attack on sight
   - Memory persists until mob is killed or memory cleared

**NPC Flags:** (ACT_* constants in structs.h)
- **ACT_SPEC:** Has special procedure
- **ACT_SENTINEL:** Won't move from spawn location
- **ACT_SCAVENGER:** Picks up valuable items
- **ACT_ISNPC:** Mark as NPC (vs player)
- **ACT_AGGRESSIVE:** Attacks players on sight
- **ACT_STAY_ZONE:** Won't leave its zone
- **ACT_WIMPY:** Flees when low on HP
- **ACT_NICE_THIEF:** Thief but won't steal from players

**Combat AI:**
- When fighting, mob makes attack each combat round
- Uses same combat system as players
- Can flee if wimpy or special procedure decides
- Special procedures can implement complex combat tactics

**Special Procedure Examples:**
- **Cityguard:** Assists other guards, protects citizens, breaks up fights
- **Janitor:** Picks up trash items and destroys them
- **Fido:** Scavenges corpses for food
- **Snake:** Poison attack
- **Magic User:** Casts spells during combat
- **Thief:** Backstab and steal
- **Receptionist:** Manages player storage
- **Guild Masters:** Train player skills and spells

**Movement Restrictions:**
- Sector restrictions (water-breathing, flying, boat-required)
- Zone boundaries (ACT_STAY_ZONE)
- Door states (closed/locked doors)
- Room flags (NO_MOB, DEATH)

### 7. Zone Reset System

**Purpose:** Dynamically repopulate areas with NPCs and objects.

**Architecture:**

**Reset Timing:** (`zone_update()` called from main loop)
- Each zone has lifespan counter
- Decrements each minute of game time
- When reaches 0, zone resets
- Lifespan resets to zone's configured value

**Reset Commands:** (loaded from .zon files)

Each zone has array of reset commands executed in sequence:

**M - Load Mobile:**
- Spawns NPC from template
- Parameters: if_flag, max_existing, mob_vnum, max_in_world, room_vnum
- If max already exist in zone/world, skips
- Sets "last mob" for subsequent G and E commands

**O - Load Object:**
- Places object in room
- Parameters: if_flag, max_existing, obj_vnum, max_in_world, room_vnum
- If max already exist, skips

**G - Give Object:**
- Gives object to last loaded mobile
- Parameters: if_flag, max_existing, obj_vnum, max_in_world
- Automatically equipped if equipment

**E - Equip Object:**
- Equips object on last loaded mobile in specific slot
- Parameters: if_flag, max_existing, obj_vnum, max_in_world, equipment_position
- Ensures proper equipment (weapons in wield slot, armor in body slot, etc.)

**P - Put in Container:**
- Places object inside container object
- Parameters: if_flag, max_existing, obj_vnum, max_in_world, container_vnum
- Container must exist in world

**D - Door State:**
- Sets door open/closed/locked status
- Parameters: if_flag, unused, room_vnum, exit_num, door_state
- Door states: 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked

**R - Remove Object:**
- Removes all objects of type from room
- Parameters: if_flag, unused, room_vnum, obj_vnum
- Used for cleanup before reset

**If-Flag System:**
- Each command has if_flag (0 or 1)
- If 1, command only executes if previous command succeeded
- Enables conditional reset chains
- Example: "If guard spawned, give guard sword, equip guard with armor"

**Max Existing Limits:**
- Commands specify maximum instances allowed
- Prevents over-spawning rare items/mobs
- Checks zone or world depending on command

**Reset Philosophy:**
- Zones reset independently
- Players can't "clear out" permanent content
- Balances exploration with respawn
- Prevents resource exhaustion

### 8. Player Persistence System

**Purpose:** Save and restore player character data between sessions.

**Architecture:**

**Player Files:**
- Single binary file: `lib/players` (configurable)
- Fixed-record format: array of `struct char_file_u`
- One record per character
- Sequential access via fseek()

**Player Index:**
- In-memory index built at boot: `player_table[]`
- Maps player name to file offset
- Enables fast lookup without scanning file
- Sorted for binary search

**Save Process:** (`save_char()` in db.c)

1. Locate player record by name in player_table
2. Convert in-memory `struct char_data` to file format `struct char_file_u`
   - Copy stats, skills, affected spells
   - Serialize worn equipment (store virtual numbers)
   - Convert pointers to portable references
3. Write record to file at calculated offset
4. Flush to disk

**Load Process:** (`load_char()` in db.c)

1. Look up player name in player_table
2. Read record from file
3. Convert `struct char_file_u` to in-memory `struct char_data`
   - Restore stats, skills, affects
   - Recreate worn equipment from virtual numbers
   - Rebuild object pointers
4. Place character in game at save location (or start room if invalid)

**Character Creation:**

1. Player enters name at login
2. System checks if name exists in player_table
3. If new:
   - Prompts for password (encrypted with crypt())
   - Prompts for sex
   - Prompts for class
   - Creates new player record
   - Rolls initial stats
   - Sets starting location
   - Saves to file
   - Adds to player_table

**Rent/Storage System:** (reception.c)

Separate from player file, stores inventory when player "rents":

1. Player goes to inn, types "offer"
2. Receptionist calculates rent cost (based on items carried)
3. Player types "rent" and pays cost
4. Items extracted from game, saved to rent file
5. Player disconnects
6. On login, items restored to inventory if rent paid

Alternative: "crash save" stores items without rent cost (original had this disabled)

**Security:**
- Passwords encrypted with Unix crypt()
- Player files not directly editable (binary format)
- God level restrictions prevent unauthorized privilege escalation

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Original system had no automatic backup
- Administrators manually copied player file
- Corruption rare due to careful pointer management

## Design Patterns and Principles

### Object-Based C Programming

Although written in C (not C++), DikuMUD uses object-oriented design patterns:

**Encapsulation:**
- Data structures combine data and behavior (e.g., char_data has stats and links to functions)
- Module boundaries enforce interface discipline
- Header files define public interfaces

**Polymorphism (Limited):**
- Function pointers enable behavior variation:
  - Special procedures (same signature, different implementations)
  - Spell functions (uniform interface)
  - Command handlers (standard protocol)

**Composition:**
- Characters contain objects (inventory)
- Objects contain objects (containers)
- Rooms contain characters and objects
- Zones contain rooms

### Global State Management

Extensive use of global variables for core game state:

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies code in single-threaded environment
- Avoids excessive parameter passing
- Common in early 90s C programs

**Key Global Variables:**
- `world[]` - All rooms
- `character_list` - All characters in game
- `object_list` - All objects in game
- `descriptor_list` - All network connections
- `player_table[]` - Player index
- `mob_index[]`, `obj_index[]` - Template indices
- `zone_table[]` - Zone definitions

**Access Pattern:**
Most functions receive only what they immediately need (e.g., char pointer), then access globals for world context.

### Virtual Number Abstraction

Separates designer-facing IDs from implementation indices:

**Benefits:**
- Enables parallel development (designers use different number ranges)
- Allows sparse numbering (zone 30 can use 3000-3099, zone 50 can use 5000-5099)
- Simplifies zone distribution and merging
- Protects data files from internal reorganization

**Implementation:**
- Data files use virtual numbers
- Boot process builds index mapping virtual → array index
- Runtime uses real (array) indices for speed
- Helper functions translate when needed

### Message-Driven Architecture

Much of the game's personality comes from text messages:

**Separation of Logic and Presentation:**
- Core systems handle mechanics
- Messages provide flavor and variety
- Enables customization without code changes

**Message Sources:**
- Combat messages (lib/messages)
- Social messages (lib/actions)
- Help text (lib/help)
- Static text (motd, news, credits)
- Zone descriptions (.wld files)
- Object descriptions (.obj files)

### Data-Driven Design Philosophy

Original DikuMUD pioneered data-driven MUD development:

**Advantages:**
- Non-programmers can create content
- Changes don't require recompilation
- Easy to add zones, items, mobs
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs

**Content vs Code:**
- Code implements game mechanics
- Data defines game content and world
- Clean separation enables content pipelines

### Command Pattern

The command system implements the command pattern:

**Structure:**
- Command name → lookup → command info → execute function
- Uniform interface for all commands
- Easy to add new commands
- Supports undo (not implemented, but architecture allows)

**Benefits:**
- Consistent user experience
- Simple to extend
- Testable in isolation

### State Machine for Connections

Connection handling uses state machine:

**States:**
- CON_GET_NAME: Waiting for player name
- CON_CONFIRM_NAME: New player, confirm name
- CON_PASSWORD: Waiting for password
- CON_NEWPASSWD: New player, enter password
- CON_CNFPASSWD: New player, confirm password
- CON_QSEX: Select sex
- CON_QCLASS: Select class
- CON_RMOTD: Reading MOTD
- CON_MENU: At main menu
- CON_PLAYING: In game
- CON_EDITING: String editing mode

**Transitions:**
- Input triggers state changes
- Each state has specific handler in `nanny()`
- Clean separation of login vs gameplay

## Reusability Analysis

### What Can Be Reused As-Is

**Core Engine Components:**
- Network communication layer (with socket updates for modern systems)

### What Needs Modernization

**Security:**
- Buffer overflows (strcpy, sprintf) → use safe string functions
- Password storage (crypt) → modern hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- Input validation → sanitize all user input
- Privilege escalation checks → harden permission system

**Network:**
- Telnet raw sockets → WebSockets or modern protocol
- Blocking I/O → async/await patterns
- Single-threaded → could benefit from threading for I/O
- IPv4 only → IPv6 support

**Memory Management:**
- Manual malloc/free → smart pointers or arena allocation
- Global linked lists → better data structures (hash tables, trees)
- Static arrays → dynamic collections
- Memory leaks possible → RAII patterns

**Persistence:**
- Binary file format → JSON, SQLite, or modern database
- Single player file → per-player files or database records
- No backup strategy → automated backups
- Limited data integrity → transactions, checksums

**Configuration:**
- Hardcoded constants → configuration files
- Compile-time settings → runtime flags
- Limited flexibility → hot-reload support

**Code Quality:**
- Missing function prototypes → full prototypes in headers
- Inconsistent error handling → structured error handling
- Limited comments → comprehensive documentation
- No unit tests → test coverage

- Established patterns for text-based multiplayer games
- Demonstrated power of community-driven development
- Showed value of data-driven game design

The codebase remains relevant for understanding multiplayer game architecture, even 30+ years later.

## Conclusion

DikuMUD's design exhibits remarkable foresight for early 1990s software. The clean separation between game mechanics (C code) and game content (data files), combined with well-defined extension points, created a system that was both powerful and accessible. The architecture's modularity and data-driven philosophy enabled a thriving community of content creators and derivative works.

For modern reuse, the core architecture and design patterns remain sound. The command system, special procedures, zone resets, and data file formats can be preserved while modernizing the implementation details (security, persistence, networking). The extension points identified here provide clear places to add new features without compromising the original design.

Understanding this codebase provides valuable insights into multiplayer game design, demonstrates the value of data-driven architecture, and offers a solid foundation for building modern text-based or hybrid multiplayer games. The patterns established here—particularly the command pattern, virtual number system, and data-driven content—remain applicable to contemporary game development.
