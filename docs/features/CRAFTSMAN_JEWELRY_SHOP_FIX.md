# Fix for Craftsman Jewelry Shop

## Problem
The Red Martian Jeweller craftsman (mob 3009) in the jewelry shop in Lesser Helium (room 3034) was not functioning as a shopkeeper. He existed in the game but had no shop configuration, so players could not buy jewelry from him.

## Root Cause
The original `.shp` file had shop #15 configured for the jewelry shop with keeper mob 3009 at room 3034, but the shop had no products (all -1 values). During YAML conversion, shop #15 was incorrectly reassigned to the leather worker (mob 3010, room 3035), leaving the jewelry shop without a functional shopkeeper.

## Solution
Created a new shop #21 for the jewelry shop while preserving shop #15 for the leather worker to maintain backward compatibility with existing tests.

## Changes Made

### 1. YAML Configuration (`dm-dist-alfa/lib/zones_yaml/lesser_helium.yaml`)

**Shop #21 Configuration:**
- **Keeper:** mob 3009 (Red Martian Jeweller craftsman)
- **Location:** room 3034 (The Jeweler's Shop)
- **Products:** 
  - 3570: Large ruby
  - 3571: Brilliant emerald
  - 3572: Perfect diamond
  - 3573: Blue sapphire
  - 3574: Golden topaz
  - 3552: Jeweled noble harness
- **Pricing:** 1.5x buy markup, 0.5x sell markup (luxury items)
- **Buy types:** Type 8 (jewelry/treasure)
- **Operating hours:** 0-28 (always open)

**Zone Resets:**
Added G (give) commands to provide mob 3009 with inventory of all jewelry items.

### 2. Test Suite (`tests/integration/shops/test_craftsman_jewelry_shop.yaml`)
Created comprehensive test script that validates:
- Shopkeeper (mob 3009) is present in room 3034
- Shop responds to 'list' command
- Jewelry items (ruby, emerald, diamond, sapphire, topaz, harness) are displayed
- Purchase attempts receive appropriate responses
- Shop validation passes without errors

## How the Shop System Works

1. **Shop Data Loading**: `boot_the_shops()` in `shop.c` reads the shop file
2. **Keeper Assignment**: `assign_the_shopkeepers()` in `shop.c` assigns the `shop_keeper` special procedure to all keeper mobs
3. **Player Interaction**: When players use commands like `list`, `buy <item>`, the `shop_keeper()` function handles the transactions

The craftsman will now automatically respond to shop commands when players are in room 3034 (The Jeweler's Shop).

## Testing

Test passes:
```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
python3 ../tools/integration_test_runner.py ./dmserver ../tests/integration/shops/test_craftsman_jewelry_shop.yaml
```

All shop tests pass:
```bash
cd dm-dist-alfa
make integration_tests
```

## In-Game Usage

Players can now:
1. Go to room 3034 (The Jeweler's Shop in Lesser Helium)
2. Type `list` to see available jewelry and gems
3. Type `buy ruby`, `buy diamond`, `buy emerald`, etc. to purchase precious gems
4. Type `buy harness` to purchase an ornate jeweled noble harness
5. Jewelry items are valuable treasure items that can be sold for gold

## Thematic Appropriateness

The jewelry selection fits the "Jeweler's Shop" theme:
- **Large ruby (3570)**: Precious red gem
- **Brilliant emerald (3571)**: Precious green gem  
- **Perfect diamond (3572)**: Most valuable gem
- **Blue sapphire (3573)**: Precious blue gem
- **Golden topaz (3574)**: Precious yellow gem
- **Jeweled noble harness (3552)**: Ornate armor decorated with gems

These are luxury items appropriate for a prosperous jeweller craftsman in Lesser Helium's commercial district.
