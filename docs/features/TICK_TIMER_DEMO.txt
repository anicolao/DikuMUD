                      TICK TIMER FEATURE DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

The tick timer shows a countdown from 75 seconds to 0 before each game tick.

PROMPT FORMAT:
--------------
XH XF XV XC T:XX Exits:XXX>

Where:
  XH = Hit Points
  XF = Mana/Force Points  
  XV = Movement Points
  XC = Coins/Gold
  T:XX = Tick Timer (seconds until next tick)
  Exits:XXX = Available exits (N,E,S,W,U,D)

SAMPLE PROMPTS SHOWING COUNTDOWN:
----------------------------------

5H 100F 82V 0C T:40 Exits:NSD>
5H 100F 82V 0C T:37 Exits:NSD> (3 seconds later)
5H 100F 82V 0C T:35 Exits:NSD> (2 seconds later)
5H 100F 82V 0C T:32 Exits:NSD> (3 seconds later)
5H 100F 82V 0C T:30 Exits:NSD> (2 seconds later)
5H 100F 82V 0C T:27 Exits:NSD> (3 seconds later)

The timer accurately counts down in real-time, showing exactly when the next
game tick (regeneration, zone resets, etc.) will occur.

COMBAT EXAMPLE:
---------------

45H 30F 60V 100C T:33 Exits:N [Warrior:pretty hurt] [troll:just a scratch]>

The tick timer is integrated seamlessly with the existing combat status display.

FEATURES:
---------
✓ Counts down from 75 to 0 in real seconds
✓ Resets to 75 after reaching 0
✓ Works with both combat and non-combat prompts
✓ No performance impact
✓ Minimal code changes

TECHNICAL NOTES:
----------------
- Game ticks occur every 75 seconds (SECS_PER_MUD_HOUR)
- The timer uses the global pulse counter (increments every 0.25 seconds)
- Calculation: secs_to_tick = (300 - (pulse % 300)) / 4
- Where 300 pulses = 75 seconds, and pulse rate is 4 per second
