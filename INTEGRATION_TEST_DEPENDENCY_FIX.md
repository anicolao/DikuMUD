# Integration Test Dependency Fix

## Problem

Integration tests were always running all tests, even when only a single test YAML file changed. This made iterative test development slow and inefficient.

## Root Cause

The integration test pattern rule in `dm-dist-alfa/makefile` (line 68) depended on the phony target `worldfiles`:

```makefile
integration_test_outputs/%.out: ../tests/integration/%.yaml dmserver worldfiles ../tools/create_test_player | integration_test_outputs
```

Since `worldfiles` is a phony target (`.PHONY`), Make treats it as always out-of-date. This caused all integration tests to rerun every time, regardless of what actually changed.

## Solution

Changed the dependency from the phony `worldfiles` target to the actual world files:

```makefile
integration_test_outputs/%.out: ../tests/integration/%.yaml dmserver lib/tinyworld.wld lib/tinyworld.mob lib/tinyworld.obj lib/tinyworld.zon lib/tinyworld.shp lib/tinyworld.qst ../tools/create_test_player | integration_test_outputs
```

This allows Make to properly track file timestamps and only rerun tests when necessary.

## Behavior After Fix

Tests now only run when:
1. **The test YAML file changes** - only that specific test reruns
2. **dmserver binary changes** - all tests rerun (correct, as the server code changed)
3. **create_test_player binary changes** - all tests rerun (correct, as the test infrastructure changed)
4. **Any tinyworld.* file changes** - all tests rerun (correct, as the game world changed)

## Testing

Verified the fix works correctly by:
- Running tests twice with no changes → tests don't rerun ✓
- Touching one test YAML → only that test reruns ✓
- Touching dmserver → all tests rerun ✓
- Touching create_test_player → all tests rerun ✓
- Touching tinyworld.mob → all tests rerun ✓

## Impact

- **Development speed**: Faster iteration when working on individual tests
- **CI/CD efficiency**: Only necessary tests run, reducing build times
- **Correctness**: Tests still run when dependencies change
- **Build system**: More accurate dependency tracking

## Known Issue

There is a separate pre-existing issue where `interpreter.o` depends on the phony target `validate-commands`, causing dmserver to rebuild on every make invocation. This is unrelated to the worldfiles dependency fix but may mask the benefits of this fix in practice. If desired, this could be addressed separately by:

1. Creating a marker file for validate-commands (similar to lib/.worldfiles_built)
2. Having validate-commands update the marker file only when validation actually changes something
3. Making interpreter.o depend on the marker file instead of the phony target

## Files Changed

- `dm-dist-alfa/makefile` - One line changed (line 68)
