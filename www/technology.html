            <h2>The Technology of Barsoom</h2>
            <p>On Barsoom, there is no magic—only science so advanced it might seem magical to the uninitiated. The ancient Martians developed technologies that modern civilizations struggle to fully understand or replicate. These devices, powered by radium and other exotic energy sources, are the legacy of a civilization millions of years old.</p>
            
            <p>In the Barsoom MUD, what other games call "spells" and "magic" are here represented as <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>devices</strong>. Scientists don't "cast spells"—they <strong>activate technologies</strong>. Nobles don't wield divine power—they command <strong>advanced equipment</strong>.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Notable Inventions &amp; Inventors</h2>
            
            <h3>Ras Thavas - The Master Mind</h3>
            <p>The greatest scientist of Barsoom, Ras Thavas perfected brain transplantation, allowing consciousness to be transferred between bodies. His work in Toonol represents the pinnacle of Martian medical science, though his ethics are questionable at best.</p>
            
            <h3>Phor Tak - The Mad Genius</h3>
            <p>Inventor of the invisibility device and disintegration ray, Phor Tak's brilliance is matched only by his madness. His laboratory in Jhama contains wonders and horrors in equal measure.</p>
            
            <h3>Carthoris - The Inventor Prince</h3>
            <p>Son of John Carter, Carthoris invented the directional compass for airships, revolutionizing navigation across Barsoom. His device allows pilots to set a destination and have the ship automatically maintain course.</p>
            
            <h3>The Atmosphere Factories</h3>
            <p>Created by ancient Martians now lost to history, these colossal machines maintain the planet's breathable air. Understanding them fully is beyond modern science—they are maintained but not truly comprehended. Control of an atmosphere factory means control over life itself on Barsoom.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Technology in Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In the Barsoom MUD, technologies work exactly like spells in traditional fantasy MUDs, but with thematic differences:</p>
            
            <h3>Activating Technologies</h3>
            <p>Instead of "casting spells," you <strong>activate technologies</strong>. Scientists learn to operate more advanced devices as they progress, while Warriors and Nobles have access to simpler equipment.</p>
            
            <h3>Power Requirements</h3>
            <p>Technologies require energy to function. More powerful devices drain more power. Scientists are most efficient with technology, while Warriors must rely on simpler, more stable devices.</p>
            
            <h3>Learning Technologies</h3>
            <p>You learn to operate technologies through practice and training. Visit scientific facilities and laboratories to expand your technological repertoire. Each technology has prerequisites—you must master simpler devices before attempting complex ones.</p>
            
            <h3>Technological Failures</h3>
            <p>When a device malfunctions (fails), it may have unpredictable effects. Poorly maintained equipment is dangerous—which is why Scientists are so valued.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Philosophy of Barsoomian Science</h2>
            <p>On Barsoom, there are no gods, no divine intervention, no mystical forces. The "gods" were exposed as frauds; the "afterlife" revealed as a cruel deception. What remains is science—cold, rational, and powerful.</p>
            
            <p>Yet Martian science is not purely mechanistic. It deals with forces and phenomena that seem magical: matter transmutation, consciousness transfer, molecular dissolution. The line between sufficiently advanced technology and magic blurs—but Martians insist it remains a line of science, not mysticism.</p>
            
            <p>This creates a unique setting where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Honor and science coexist—Warriors respect Scientists, and Scientists train in swordplay</li>
                <li>Ancient devices work perfectly despite being millennia old</li>
                <li>New inventions are rare but revolutionary</li>
                <li>Technology serves culture, not replaces it</li>
                <li>Understanding is valued, but so is courage and honor</li>
            </ul>
