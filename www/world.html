            <h2>Barsoom: The Dying World</h2>
            <p>Mars—known to its inhabitants as <strong>Barsoom</strong>—is an ancient, dying world. Once blessed with vast oceans and abundant life, the planet now struggles for survival. Its great seas have evaporated over millions of years, leaving behind endless dead sea bottoms covered in rust-red ochre moss. The atmosphere, once thick and rich, has thinned to dangerous levels, maintained only through massive atmosphere factories scattered across the planet.</p>
            
            <p>This is a world of contradictions: ancient civilizations preserve sophisticated technology while savage tribes roam ruined cities; codes of honor govern society while assassination guilds thrive in the shadows; airships patrol the skies while swordplay remains the measure of a warrior's worth.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Geography &amp; Climate</h2>
            
            <h3>The Dead Sea Bottoms</h3>
            <p>Vast expanses of what were once mighty oceans now form the dead sea bottoms—flat, ochre moss-covered plains stretching for hundreds of miles. Ancient harbor cities, once coastal, now sit isolated in the midst of these desolate expanses. The moss provides minimal sustenance for the hardy beasts that roam these wastes.</p>
            
            <h3>The Polar Regions</h3>
            <p>Both poles retain ice caps and glaciers, though much diminished from ancient times. The North Pole is home to the secretive Yellow Martian civilization, hidden in ice-bound cities. The South Pole contains the legendary Valley Dor, believed by many to be the afterlife—though in truth, it is a beautiful death trap leading to the underground Sea of Omean.</p>
            
            <h3>Atmosphere &amp; Weather</h3>
            <p>The thin atmosphere is breathable but barely so, maintained by colossal atmosphere factories. These ancient machines pump processed gases into the sky, preventing total atmospheric collapse. Control of an atmosphere factory means control over the survival of nearby regions—making them strategic targets and heavily defended positions.</p>
            
            <p>Temperature extremes are harsh: scorching heat during the day, bitter cold at night. Dust storms can rage for days, grounding airships and forcing even the hardiest warriors to seek shelter.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Major Civilizations</h2>
            
            <h3>The City-States of the Red Martians</h3>
            <p>Red Martian civilization is organized into independent city-states, each ruled by a Jeddak (emperor) or Jed (king). The greatest of these is <strong>Helium</strong>, actually twin cities connected by enormous bridges spanning seventy-five miles. Other major powers include Zodanga (militaristic and aggressive), Ptarth (scientific and cultural), and Gathol (strategic and proud).</p>
            
            <p>These cities are architectural marvels of jeweled towers, vast plazas, and sophisticated infrastructure. They maintain airship fleets, standing armies, and research facilities. While often at war with one another, they share a common culture valuing honor, martial prowess, and scientific achievement.</p>
            
            <h3>The Green Martian Hordes</h3>
            <p>The nomadic Green Martians occupy the ruins of ancient cities and roam the dead sea bottoms in tribal hordes. The greatest of these is the <strong>Thark</strong> horde, known for producing warriors of exceptional skill despite their harsh culture. Warhoon, Torquas, and other hordes compete for territory and resources, following chiefs who rule through strength alone.</p>
            
            <p>Green Martian culture forbids displays of emotion and familial bonds, with eggs hatched communally and the weak culled mercilessly. Yet individuals like Tars Tarkas prove that Green Martians can transcend their brutal culture to embrace honor and friendship.</p>
            
            <h3>The Underground Realms</h3>
            <p>Beneath the surface lies another world entirely. The <strong>Sea of Omean</strong>, an underground ocean fed by mysterious currents, is ruled by the Black Pirates (First Born), who raid the surface world from hidden entrances. The White Martians (Therns) maintain temples and fortresses in these subterranean regions, once using them to perpetuate their religious fraud.</p>
            
            <h3>The Northern Kingdom</h3>
            <p>Hidden beneath the ice of the North Pole, the Yellow Martians live in splendid isolation in cities like <strong>Kadabra</strong> and <strong>Marentina</strong>. Technologically advanced but xenophobic, they guard their secrets jealously and consider themselves superior to other Martian races. Their isolation has preserved ancient knowledge lost elsewhere on Barsoom.</p>

            <h2>Culture &amp; Society</h2>
            
            <h3>The Code of Honor</h3>
            <p>Most civilized Martians, especially Red Martians, live by a strict code of honor. A warrior's word is sacred; betrayal is the gravest sin; courage in battle is expected; and protecting the weak (especially women) is mandatory. This code transcends political boundaries—even enemies respect it.</p>
            
            <h3>Martial Tradition</h3>
            <p>Every civilized Martian learns swordplay. Even scientists and nobles train in combat, for Barsoom is a harsh world where danger lurks everywhere. The long sword is the weapon of honor; cowardice in battle brings eternal shame.</p>
            
            <h3>Egg-Laying &amp; Longevity</h3>
            <p>Martians are oviparous (lay eggs) and incredibly long-lived—hundreds of years for most races, with some individuals reaching a millennium. This longevity creates stable civilizations but also entrenched traditions and old grudges that never die.</p>
            
            <h3>Technology vs. "Magic"</h3>
            <p>What might appear as magic is actually advanced science: radium weapons, matter transmitters, invisibility devices, atmospheric processing, brain transplantation, and more. The "gods" proved to be frauds; the "afterlife" a cruel deception. Only technology and the strength of one's sword arm can be trusted.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Dying World's Struggle</h2>
            <p>Every Martian lives with the knowledge that their world is dying. Resources grow scarcer with each generation. Cities compete desperately for water, fertile land, and access to atmosphere factories. Ancient ruins hint at former glory, now lost to time and environmental collapse.</p>
            
            <p>Yet Martians refuse to surrender. They maintain their civilizations, uphold their codes of honor, pursue scientific advancement, and fight for survival with the same courage their ancestors showed a million years ago. In this context, every action matters—every alliance, every discovery, every battle could tip the balance between survival and extinction.</p>
            
            <p>Will you help preserve what remains of Martian civilization? Or will you be the one to discover the secrets that might restore Barsoom to its former glory?</p>
