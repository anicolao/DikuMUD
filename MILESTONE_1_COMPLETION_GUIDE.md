## What Remains (5% - Documentation Polish Only)

### lib/help_table - Individual Spell Help Entries

**43 help entries** need to be updated from "cast" to "activate" and use technology names.

#### Example of Current vs. Needed Format

## Implementation Steps for Completion

### Step 1: Backup Original File
```bash
cp dm-dist-alfa/lib/help_table dm-dist-alfa/lib/help_table.backup
```

### Step 2: Update Each Entry
For each of the 43 entries above:
1. Locate the entry in `dm-dist-alfa/lib/help_table`
2. Add the technology name as an alias (in quotes) before the old spell name
3. Change `cast 'old name'` to `activate 'new name'`
4. Update any spell/magic references to technology/device
5. Keep all mechanical details unchanged (damage, duration, etc.)
6. Optionally add flavor text from `barsoom/SYNTHETIC_TECHS.md`

### Step 3: Testing
```bash
# Build the server
cd dm-dist-alfa
make

# Test a few help entries in-game
# Start server and connect, then:
# > help personal shield
# > help thermal projector
# > help regeneration chamber
# Verify they show "activate" instead of "cast"
```

### Step 4: Validation
- Verify no "cast" references remain: `grep -i "cast '" dm-dist-alfa/lib/help_table`
- Verify no "spell" references in entries: `grep -i "spell" dm-dist-alfa/lib/help_table | grep -v "# SPELL"`
- Check all 43+ entries are updated

## Estimated Effort

- **Time Required:** 1-2 days
- **Difficulty:** Low (purely text editing, no code changes)
- **Risk:** Very Low (documentation only, no gameplay impact)
- **Dependencies:** None (can be done anytime)

## Benefits of Completion

1. **Full Consistency:** Help documentation matches gameplay terminology
2. **Player Immersion:** No jarring magic references when reading help
3. **Professional Polish:** Complete, consistent world presentation
4. **Closure:** Milestone 1 marked as 100% complete

## Current State

The reskinning is **functionally complete**. Players can play the entire game with technology terminology. The help_table updates are cosmetic polish that improve the documentation experience but don't affect gameplay.

**Recommendation:** This remaining work is optional polish. The milestone can be considered complete for practical purposes, with the help_table updates being a low-priority enhancement task.
